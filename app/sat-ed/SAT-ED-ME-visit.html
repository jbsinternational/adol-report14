<li> The project coordinator needs high-level leadership to assist in leading and managing the project through the next 2 years. </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Interagency Collaboration	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Interagency Council has established four working groups: – Recovery and Support Workgroup<br />
– Agency Selection Workgroup<br />
– School-Based Health Center Workgroup<br />
– Learning Collaborative Workgroup </li>

<li> Memorandums of understanding are not in place with child-serving agencies. 
<li> All relevant agencies have to still be engaged in finance work.

<ul>
<li>Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program are supporting some treatment services for youth with substance use/co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders. </li>

<li> Medicaid will also cover the cost of Multisystemic Therapy and Functional Family Therapy. </li>
<li> The commissioner is committed to youth and families and an agenda for change; she has indicated interest in addressing financing issues.

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The full continuum of treatment, including recovery services and supports for youth with substance use disorders, may not be reimbursed. </li>
<li> Financing for substance use treatment and mental health services is managed by two separate agencies. </li>

<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation of Evidence-Based Practices	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Maine has strong, committed, and experienced providers at the site level.</li>
<li>The providers are proactive at both sites. Trainings in Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA) and Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN) are complete; staff are being certified in A-CRA, and enrollment of clients has begun. </li>
<li> Both providers are interested in geographic expansion. • Both providers use electronic health records. </li>
<li> Both providers expressed support of the A-CRA Assertive Continuing Care (ACC) model. </li>
<li> Both providers emphasized that the family component of A-CRA is essential.</li>
<li> SAMHS demonstrated a commitment to expanding the evidence-based practice (EBP). </li>
<li> SAT-ED staff are exploring different models, such as expanding existing providers and outreach to new providers, especially in rural areas.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The State needs clarification on how site funds can be used.</li>
<li>Rural areas and small providers need to consider training and supervision models.</li>
<li> There is a need for a clear timeframe for training and certification in GAIN and A-CRA.</li>
<li> There is a need for more family and youth involvement at the program and practice levels. </li>
<li>Financing all the components of A-CRA/ACC has been challenging, especially for the family sessions, collateral contacts, and continuing care. </li>
<li>The State can explore opportunities to expand understanding how to use SAT-ED resources to bring in additional providers and train them.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
<li> Increase collaboration between providers as capacity increases.</li>
<li> Develop a plan for working with Medicaid managed care organizations in preparation for eligibility expansion. </li>

  <li> Youth and families are providing peer-to-peer support at the grassroots level. </li>
  <li> There is a strong recovery community in Portland to build from and spread across the State.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>

  <li> Youth representatives highlighted the need to work with primary care physicians to follow through after screenings. </li>
  <li> There is no infrastructure or support for organized family involvement.</li>
  <li> There is a need for centralized, uniform, accurate treatment and recovery information for youth and families. </li>
  <li> Maine should consider a centralized screening and intake system. </li>
  <li> There is a need to engage family members and ensure family members are on the interagency council. </li>
  <li> Family involvement needs to be included at the both the program and practice levels at the provider sites. </li>
  <li> There is a need to support peer-to-peer support for youth and for families.</li>
</li>
</ul>

  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>

<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>

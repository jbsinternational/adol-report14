                            <p>The Kentucky Substance Abuse Treatment Enhancement and Dissemination (KAT-ED) has a solid foundation in child and adolescent services and an active State Interagency Council for Services to Children with Emotional Disabilities (SIAC). The team has partnered with the Kentucky Partnership for Families and Children and has integrated youth and families across all activities. Youth are included in the SIAC and in program activities. The team has begun incorporating workforce survey information into a workforce development plan and map. Staff are being trained to implement evidence-based practices (EBPs), though a statewide plan for EBP implementation is yet to be developed. Kentucky is redesigning its children and adolescent services and systems. The KAT-ED team is involved in these discussions and will continue to address system changes as service implementation continues.</p>

                            <p>The Maine Youth Treatment Recovery Enhancement Project (MYTREP) team has dedicated staff and partners who have laid the foundation to address statewide infrastructure. The project coordinator is committed to the project’s success, and the adolescent treatment coordinator has worked beyond the allocated time to support the project. There is active communication among the Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services (SAMHS) management and SAT-ED staff and partners. Going forward, Maine can incorporate the SAT-ED initiative as an agency-wide priority and ensure the SAT-ED coordinator has direct access to high-level leadership within both SAMHSA and other child-serving agencies.</p>

                            <p>The Indiana SAT-ED’s principal investigator and project administrator have led in the initiative’s rapid advancement. There is active communication among management staff from the Indiana Division of Mental Health and Addiction (DMHA), SAT-ED staff, treatment providers, families, youth, and stakeholders. The initiative exhibits many strengths despite staffing delays and DMHA’s decision (approved by SAMHSA) to replace its assessment tool and treatment model. Indiana can use this momentum to build and sustain collaborative relationships across all child-serving agencies, complete financial maps, develop and execute a workforce training implementation plan, support the two evidence-based treatment provider sites, incorporate ideas suggested by youth and family members, and develop infrastructure evaluation measures.</p>

The Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS) leadership is dedicated and can use its staff experience and priority focus to increase support for NY-SAINT to accomplish numerous adolescent infrastructure tasks: identify a lead person for a workforce development plan and a chair for its financial mapping workgroup; organize the voice for families and youth to strengthen adolescent access to treatment; develop a strong and informed qualitative evaluation; focus on project-level outcomes with detailed timelines; and consider hiring individuals representative of its adolescent treatment population for any enhanced NY-SAINT staffing pattern. </p>

Its partnership with the Addictive and Mental Disorders Division has provided a foundation for improving treatment for adolescents with substance use disorders and co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders. CMHB can further strengthen Montana’s adolescent treatment system and the project’s  sustainability in several ways: augment project staff with an individual experienced in youth substance abuse issues; formalize memorandums of agreement encompassing financial mapping and workforce development with other agencies; continue developing the financial mapping workgroup and leadership; explore Medicaid match equality for services for youth with primary SUDs; increase the youth and family voice; and implement and disseminate an appropriate evidence-based practice.</p>

It has supported several training events for providers and other child-serving staff, such as the neuroscience of adolescent drug use and training for youth on leadership and peer recovery support. ODMHSAS can build on this momentum by augmenting SAT-ED staff, continuing to develop interagency collaboration, assembling a financial mapping workgroup, preparing a workforce dissemination plan, and increasing treatment access for youth with primary SUDs and their families.</p>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Awardee Leadership	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li> The SAT-ED team is fully staffed with experienced personnel, including a project director, assistant director, and a senior consultant who leads financial mapping and reports to the Department of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Services (DAODAS) director. </li>
<li> DAODAS has an involved and committed agency director. </li>
<li> South Carolina and DAODAS continue to leverage Federal grant resources to build system capacity and enhance and strengthen treatment services for adolescents with substance use and co-occurring mental health disorders.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>There appears to be an absence of direct project staffing accountability for the Family and Youth Involvement requirement of the SAT-ED award.  </li>
  <li> The responsibilities of the SAT-ED project assistant director need further clarification. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Further clarify the roles and responsibilities of the SAT-ED project director and assistant director, particularly as they relate to each SAT-ED requirement area. </li>
      <li> Assign or direct staff to have accountability for facilitating continued youth and family involvement. </li>
      <li> Further define the roles of the evaluators to provide the outcome data and timely project continuous quality improvement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Need for Technical Assistance Requests</b>  </li>
  </ul>
</div> 
     
<h3 class="accordion-header">Interagency Collaboration	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li> South Carolina has robust interagency collaboration facilitated through the Joint Council on Children and Adolescents composed of all agency directors and family representatives from the following child-serving entities: Federation of Families South Carolina (FFSC); the National Alliance on Mental Illness; and child advocacy groups (i.e., Children’s Trust, Children’s Law Center). </li>
<li> The Joint Council employs a rotating leadership among the child-serving agency directors. </li>
<li> The Joint Council has an executive steering committee composed of the operational leadership within the core child-serving agencies to help drive, implement, and monitor project progress and outcomes. </li>
<li> The Joint Council also has established working committees in the SAT-ED required areas of workforce development and evaluation. These working committees meet regularly. </li>
<li> The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) director (Medicaid authority) hasbeen reelected to a second term as chair of the Joint Council.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>There is no existing finance working committee. 
<li> The SAT-ED initiative is not currently being integrated with competing priorities. • There is no youth representative on the Joint Council.</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li> Recruit, elect, orient, and support one or more youth in substance use disorder (SUD) recovery on the Joint Council.  </li>
      <li> Develop a Joint Council finance subcommittee. </li>
      <li> Develop and identify a leader for the finance subcommittee to help drive and implement financial mapping and reimbursement parity. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Need for Technical Assistance Requests</b></li>
</ul>
</div> 

<h3 class="accordion-header">Financing and Financial Mapping	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul><li> The DAODAS-commissioned Mercer report on substance use disorder (SUD) treatment funding provides information, outlines strengths and challenges of current financing, and proposes possible system enhancements.  </li>
  <li> The South Carolina HHS Medicaid authority is responsive, experienced in behavioral health, and works collaboratively to facilitate a quality continuum of treatment, continuing care, and recovery services. The authority has indicated its willingness to address Federal and State fiscal policies including reimbursement issues. </li>
  <li> The financial policy session included an excellent representation of child-serving agencies. </li>
  <li> DAODAS has hired a dedicated staff member to lead the financing and financial mapping initiative.  </li>
  <li> The DAODAS director has a background in financial administrative services. •  DAODAS requested and received three financial mapping readiness technical assistance (TA) visits and has now requested Federal TA to begin the next steps of financial mapping. </li>
  <li> The DAODAS director placed financial mapping on the 2013 Joint Council’s final agenda.  </li>
  <li> The director of HHS (Medicaid authority) chairs the Joint Council and has expressed commitment to address fiscal disparities among services and reimbursements for SUD and co-occurring mental health disorders. </li>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li> There is no parity in SUD and mental health disorder reimbursement rates for comparable services. </li>
<li> South Carolina has a bifurcated SUD and mental health disorder system structure. Mental health is not a State authority under the same governance model as the other child-serving agencies (i.e., not under Governor’s authority). This structure contributes to inconsistent collaboration and fiscal policy development. </li>
<li> South Carolina’s county governance for SUD treatment services contributes to inconsistent reimbursement rates and contract mandates.  </li>
<li> DAODAS is still adjusting to being “carved in” to a new managed care organization (MCO) system.</li>
<li> There is no reimbursement structure or culture for recovery supports.</li>
<li> There is no established cross-agency financing committee at the Joint Council level.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li>Develop a strong cross-agency committee to implement financial mechanisms and other reforms and financial mapping at the Joint Council level. </li>
      <li> Disseminate the Mercer report to support key process steps and provide baseline information to begin financial mapping. </li>
      <li> Conduct orientation to behavioral health services and evidence-based practices (EBPs)–such as the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN), Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach/Assertive Continuing Care (A-CRA/ACC), and recovery services–for all managed care organizationss. </li>
      <li> Develop a strong cross-agency financial mapping committee, and begin to implement a financial mapping plan (provide roster by January 31, 2014).  </li>
      <li> Ensure financial mapping gets the same priority as workforce development and other Joint Council subcommittees.</li>
      <li> The Department of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Services (DAODAS)and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) could benefit from a study on the differential reimbursement rates, access, treatment services gaps, and parity in the SUD and mental health disorder systems.</li>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Workforce Development	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>DAODAS has a well-developed and cohesive SAT-ED workforce committee. </li>
  <li> The workforce committee has created adolescent treatment core competencies based on SAMHSA’s Technical Assistance Publication (TAP) 21 core competencies updated to include trauma-informed care (TIC) and system of care (SOC) models. </li>
  <li> The DAODAS SAT-ED learning management system (LMS) has universal access points permitting a wide range of users (e.g., teachers, faith community, parents). </li>
  <li> The DAODAS SAT-ED LMS is competency based and provides immediate continuing education credits at completion of each training event reflecting a test score of 80 percent or greater.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> The DAODAS SAT-ED workforce committee needs to develop more training content. </li>
  <li> South Carolina’s teaching institutions do not currently offer many curricula to prepare the workforce to deliver SUD and co-occurring mental health disorder treatment.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li>Tie training about Government Performance and Result Act (GPRA) requirements to the learning management system (LMS) platform. </li>
      <li> Consider reestablishing curricula for South Carolina teaching institutions to prepare the workforce to deliver SUD and co-occurring mental health disorder treatment. </li>
      <li> Continue to develop the extensive potential of the LMS. </li>
    </ul>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation of Evidence-Based Practices	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Both McCord and Keystone have many accomplishments: <br />
    – Have completed their Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN) and Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach Assertive Continuing Care (ACRA–ACC) training <br />
    – Have experienced staff effectively using the evidence-based practice (EBP) <br />
    – Have begun seeing clients and have steady referral sources – Have certified supervisors – Are implementing ACC using the same staff<br />
– Are implementing their EBPs in schools and community sites <br />
– Are implementing activities for youth and parents that foster positive social interactions <br />
– Appear to have formal outreach and credible referral sources</li>
  <li> Once initially engaged, both McCord and Keystone are able to maintain youth engagement in treatment.  </li>
  <li> There appears to be an authentic connection between staff and the youth and families.  </li>
  <li> DAODAS has brought on four new sites to be operational in January.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li> Sites conveyed challenges with treatment initiation. </li>
<li> There was limited recovery support including peer support. </li>
<li> There is a concern about expanding the EBPs because of developer cost and certification constraints. </li>
<li> There is a concern that the current rate structure does not support the full cost of EBP implementation.  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Explore opportunities to increase youth engagement in treatment.</li>
      <li> Explore opportunities for reimbursement for recovery support including peer support. </li>
      <li> Explore opportunities to align the reimbursement rates with the true costs of EBPs. </li>

</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Family and Youth Involvement	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul><li> The South Carolina SAT-ED initiative has a formal contract with the FFSC to work with families of youth with SUDs.</li>
  <li> Youth appeared to benefit from and articulated understanding of EBPs such as ACRA, dialectical behavioral therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy.</li>
  <li> The provider was aligned with youth in recovery. Youth appeared connected to provider staff who demonstrated authentic concern for the youth. </li>
  <li> There is evidence of varied positive social interaction opportunities for youth. </li>
  <li> Interviewed youth reported an array of services and “things that give us hope for the future.” </li>
  <li> FFSC has adapted the Ohio Checklist. </li>
  <li> South Carolina has a Youth Move initiative that has reached out to youth with primary SUDs to increase youth involvement. This effort has included focus groups and training and work toward the development of site-level youth advisory councils. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul><li> No structure is in place to facilitate leadership for youth with SUDs.</li>
  <li> Parents of youth with SUDs do not currently have a structure to access support specifically for assistance with adolescent SUD issues.</li>
  <li> Youth reported experiencing transportation issues with unannounced delays during travel, arriving late, or at times perceiving unsafe driving. The youth reported these transportation issues as barriers that affect participation level and conflict with other positive aspects of their lives (e.g., school activities, employment).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li> Encourage the Federation of Families South Carolina (FFSC) to consider adding a codirector with specific SUD expertise.
</li>
      <li> Continue to develop outreach activities for youth and address transportation barriers.        </li>
      <li> Consider developing peer-to-peer recovery services and supports.        </li>
      <li> Integrate SUDs into the Youth Move model.        </li>
      <li> Develop a structure to facilitate leadership for youth with SUDs.</li>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Evaluation	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>  The SAT-ED awardee has an experienced and committed evaluation team. </li>
  <li>The SAT-ED awardee has a well-developed plan that supports accountability, outcomes measures, and continuous quality improvement (i.e., formative evaluation). </li>
  <li> The evaluation team develops, implements, and maintains well-defined databases to support the SAT-ED award. </li>
  <li> The evaluation team can produce comprehensive management reports on current data and trend analysis for system accountability and forecasting treatment services issues and needs.  </li>
  <li>Since the evaluation team is experienced working with many child-serving agencies in South Carolina, the team can easily interface with established system databases. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a need for further clarification of the roles of the evaluator, the SAT-ED project director, and the assistant director.  </li>
<li> It is not clear how data are being used to help manage the SAT-ED initiative.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>  
    <ul><li>Further define the roles of the evaluators, the SAT-ED project director, and the assistant director.</li>
      <li> Integrate SAT-ED evaluation deliverables and SAT-ED goals, and maintain a firewall between implementation and evaluation.</li>
      <li> Hold a management meeting to further determine and support the respective roles of the SAT-ED project director, assistant director, and the evaluation team.</li>
    </ul>

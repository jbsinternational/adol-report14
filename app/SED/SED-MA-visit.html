    <div id="accordion-container">
<h3 class="accordion-header">Awardee Leadership	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Bureau of Substance Abuse Services (BSAS) has a capable, knowledgeable director who is supportive of the SAT-ED project and other youth initiatives. </li>
<li> The single State Authority (SSA) is hiring a deputy director for health integration and planning. </li>
<li> The Office of Youth and Young Adult Services (OYYAS) is within the SSA, started under a State Adolescent Treatment Coordination grant.</li>
<li> The SAT-ED initiative is situated within OYYAS, with dedicated staff and contributions by OYYAS leadership. </li>
<li> The OYYAS director has a direct-line reporting relationship with the SSA director.  </li>
<li> There is a strong focus on providing adequate system capacity and quality substance use disorder (SUD) services.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> SSA leadership and OYYAS management have the challenge of addressing various major reforms and additional funding initiatives in a short time, potentially detracting from the SAT-ED project.</li>
  <li> The staffing pattern must be organized effectively to manage multiple tasks throughout the award.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li> Prioritize various State-inspired initiatives while ensuring the sustainability of the SAT-ED initiative. </li>
      <li> Ensure the staffing pattern is constructed to manage multiple tasks throughout the award.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div> 
     
<h3 class="accordion-header">Interagency Collaboration	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The SSA has an inclusive interagency workgroup (IWG) with strong leadership that has been in place for 13 years.</li>
<li>There is a youth representative.  </li>
<li> The IWG has become the forum to address issues that affect child-serving systems in the Commonwealth; it is open to a free exchange of ideas and a collective desire to seek remedies.  </li>
<li> The IWG is composed of the appropriate officials and representatives from child-serving agencies and the judiciary who are empowered to effect policy and programmatic change. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li> Medicaid and the Division of Insurance do not have representation on the IWG.</li>
<li> The IWG would benefit from an active family member participant.  </li>
<li> The IWG needs to set priorities for the near term with the many opportunities ahead.  </li>
<li> The IWG needs to establish true integration between mental health and SUD systems and between SUD systems and primary care.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li>Explore through the financial mapping processes opportunities for real and sustainable integration. </li>
      <li> Strengthen and sustain the family and youth voice within the interagency workgroup (IWG) . </li>
      <li> Recruit high-level Medicaid and Division of Insurance officials to participate on the IWG. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div> 

<h3 class="accordion-header">Financing and Financial Mapping	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 

<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li> There is significant outpatient health insurance coverage for the adolescent population.</li>
<li> There is a well-established Medicaid behavioral health carve-out and a health maintenance organization (HMO) network, providing consumer choice.  </li>
<li>Medicaid covers a range of levels of SUD care, including all outpatient care. </li>
<li> BSAS has a vision and commitment to create a better integrated and diverse system of funding.</li>
<li> Because of its regulatory authority, BSAS has leverage as both a public health and SSA institution. </li>
<li> At the planning level, resources have been allocated to address opiate and nonopiate addiction services.  </li>
<li> BSAS and its sister agencies are actively engaged in the financial mapping process and are working with Medicaid.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li> To provide parity for youth with SUDs, CBHI must identify and include in the Commonwealth’s coverage an array of services for co-occurring disorders and corresponding rates.</li>
<li> There does not appear to be a formal financial mapping subworkgroup.  </li>
<li> Significant technical cross-systems data challenges pose a barrier to addressing comprehensive care for youth with SUDs and/or co-occurring disorders.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Establish a financial mapping workgroup empowered to collect data from disparate systems under the IWG. </li>
      <li> Continue to work on the interim financial map designed for submission to SAMHSA in June 2014. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Workforce Development	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 

<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The SAT-ED initiative has a workforce dissemination plan that links to a bureau-wide strategy.</li>
  <li>BSAS has an internal workforce development committee that continues to work with key stakeholders across the Commonwealth.    </li>
  <li>BSAS supports a robust workforce development Web site.    </li>
  <li> BSAS is rewriting the standards of care with opportunities to codify changes in contractual language specific to adolescent treatment services.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>BSAS acknowledges some discordance among the licensed and certified clinicians in the Commonwealth relative to BSAS’s identified workforce capacity needs.    </li>
  <li> BSAS needs to define equity and parity across master’s-level SUD and mental health clinicians. </li>
  <li>Retaining trained clinicians in provider-level SUD services in the Commonwealth relative to other better funded child-serving agencies remains a challenge.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li>Have the Bureau of Substance Abuse Services (BSAS) continue the work of codification of certification and licensing requirements to work in the system of care. </li>
      <li> Have BSAS continue working with Medicaid and the Division of Insurance to ensure reimbursement parity for services provided by master’s-level trained substance use disorder (SUD) and mental health clinicians. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation of Evidence-Based Practices	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Both provider sites are certified in the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs Assessment (GAIN) assessment and Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA)/Assertive Continuing Care (ACC).
</li>
<li>Both providers are meeting their intake targets and being proactive in planning for seasonal variations.
  </li>
<li>Both providers have bilingual capability.
  </li>
<li> The SSA has contracted with a competent intermediary, IH&R, to provide training and coaching on A-CRA/ACC at the provider site levels.
  </li>
<li> Both providers expressed support for the A-CRA/ACC model and a desire to sustain it in the future. </li>
<li> Both providers have competent co-occurring disorder services.  </li>
<li> Both providers are sensitive to the need to provide trauma-informed care services </li>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Providers do not see value in sustaining the GAIN assessment as most providers in the Commonwealth are using a Massachusetts-developed assessment that is complementary to CANS and reimbursed by Medicaid.</li>
<li> The GAIN assessment is not reimbursable, and there is no plan to pursue reimbursement.  </li>
<li> It is a challenge to retain staff trained in evidence-based practices (EBPs) and address the costs attached to recertification of clinicians and supervisors.  </li>
<li> One of the two pilot providers will take at least another year for staff to become proficient in A-CRA/ACC. </li>
<li> There is a need to develop co-occurring disorder services in an integrated fashion. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li>Continue efforts to secure a rate to support the Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA)/Assertive Continuing Care (ACC) in partnership with the Children’s Behavioral Health Initiative (CBHI) and Medicaid. </li>
      <li> Encourage the North Suffolk site to budget or leverage funds to support the delivery of A-CRA/ACC in year 4. </li>
      <li> Continue to enhance the integration of co-occurring disorder services. </li>
      <li> Work with Government Project Officer to address challenges with use of Global Appraisal of Individual Needs Assessment (GAIN) within the Commonwealth. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Family and Youth Involvement	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 

<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Youth and family are strongly represented on the IWG.</li>
  <li> Family and youth advocates have well-developed knowledge and are able to articulate future needs and directions for the adolescent treatment and recovery systems.    </li>
  <li> Staff have conceptualized a continuum of care that includes community-based services as a step-down for opiate treatment or frontline treatment for nonopiate SUDs.    </li>
  <li> There is strong support for peer support, 12-step support groups, and recovery high schools. </li>
  <li> There is support for harm reduction models and medication-assisted treatment services for youth and adults.    </li>
  <li>The Massachusetts Organization for Addiction Recovery (MOAR) and Learn to Cope have a strong statewide network developed to engage youth and families.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul><li>Naivety regarding SUDs among mainstream middle and high school officials is a challenge considering the prevalence of use and lack of information regarding access to treatment and recovery support.</li>
  <li> There are concerns of overuse of both SUD and psychiatric medication; there is a need to structure and monitor use of suboxone.</li>
  <li> There is a need for posttreatment recovery support that includes sober living and recovery coaches engaged to support sober living skills. </li>
  <li> Parents need more education regarding treatment access, options, and recovery supports. </li>
  <li> Parents voiced concerns and challenges for early intervention for nonopiate treatment.</li></ul>

  <li> The evaluator articulated an evaluation for the infrastructure and site level.  </li>
  <li> The team is actively implementing the evaluation plan. </li>
  <li> The team is working beyond the required elements.</li>

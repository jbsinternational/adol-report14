<h3 class="accordion-header">Awardee Leadership	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The single State authority (SSA) director from the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) Division of Behavioral Health (DBH) and other key staff participated in the site visit.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Award activities are occurring at a bureau staff level and need greater involvement of upper‐level policymakers.</li>
<li>Many high‐level activities will need to take place in the remaining 18 months of the award.</li>
<li>In June 2014, the current SAT‐ED project director is leaving the position.
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
<li> Enhance SAT-ED staffing to adequately accomplish the numerous high-level required tasks in the remaining timeframe.</li>
<li>Develop a clear succession plan for a new SAT-ED project director and consider elevating this position to a direct report to the single State authority (SSA).</li>
<li>Increase the involvement and leadership of the SSA director in the SAT-ED initiative.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div> 
     
<h3 class="accordion-header">Interagency Collaboration	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li> IDPH has some of the required interagency council members.</li>
<li> An interagency council Web site has been created on the IDPH server and includes access to important SAT‐ED information and Webinars.</li>
<li> The Web site can be found at http://www.idph.state.ia.us/bh/families_focus.asp.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Iowa’s SAT‐ED team uses a subcommittee of its Strategic Prevention Framework State Incentive Grant (SPF-SIG) advisory council to meet its SAT‐ED interagency council requirement, and its respective representatives are not fully inclusive of the award’s requirements. Members from the Iowa Medicaid Enterprise, Iowa Department of Education, and youth in recovery are not represented.</li>
<li>The council has not held regular meetings, there is limited shared understanding of the award goals, and the subcommittee members have not developed a shared agenda and mission statement.</li>
<li>SPF‐SIG advisory council activities lack clear and formalized communication structure to ensure access to policymakers with high‐level authority.</li>
<li>A formal sustainability plan has not been developed to move the subcommittee's work from a short‐term award oversight collaboration to a long‐term system transformation opportunity that will continue after funding ends.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
 <li>Develop a formalized structure for access to policymakers at the highest levels of State government to address SAT-ED issues.
<li>Recruit and add members to the Strategic Prevention Framework State Incentive Grant (SPF-SIG) advisory council and the SAT-ED subcommittee to meet the SAT-ED award requirements.</li>
<li>Enhance the activities of the SPF-SIG advisory council and the SAT-ED subcommittee to work on system-level policy, funding, and cross-collaboration transformation activities.</li>
<li>Recruit a SAT-ED subcommittee chair who is strong in policy development and can work across government levels at horizontal and vertical levels. Although a family member may make an excellent cochair, the team suggests that the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) contact SAT-ED staff in Kentucky to discuss effective cochair model strategies.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Need for Technical Assistance Requests</b>
  <ul>
  <li> 
Consider including peer-to-peer technical assistance (TA) as part of discussions with Kentucky SAT-ED on cochair model strategies. 
  </li>
  </ul>
  
</ul>
</div> 

<h3 class="accordion-header">Financing and Financial Mapping	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
 <li>Iowa has advanced in its combined use of public, private, and other payer resources to fund adolescent substance use disorder (SUD) treatment.</li>
 <li>Approximately 60 percent of adolescent SUD treatment is paid by Medicaid, 30 percent is paid by private insurance, and 10 percent is from other sources.</li>
 <li>The use of Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) block grant funding in Iowa is creatively aligned with a person’s need to access treatment services (copays) and paying for youth services.</li>
 <li>Access to Recovery (ATR) is providing service to adolescents.</li>
 <li>Iowa has created flexibility in the Medicaid treatment billing codes and the potential to bill at an enhanced rate for certain services.</li>
 <li>Pediatric health homes are in the second phase of statewide implementation.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Iowa does not have parity between the services that are provided for youth with a primary mental health disorder diagnosis and those that are for youth with a primary diagnosis of SUD.</li>
<li>As all service types are not available for adolescents with SUDs, treatment providers sometimes use mental health codes to get treatment for SUDs in the “dollars‐follow‐the‐diagnosis” model.</li>
<li>The pediatric health home implementation is available for youth with a primary mental disorder diagnosis but not for those with a primary SUD diagnosis.</li>
<li>Iowa’s development and implementation of new health care programs and financing opportunities have not included a formal strategy to maximize the SAT‐ED award activities to ensure adequate resources for adolescent SUD treatment and recovery resources.</li></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
<li>Pursue policy change opportunities that will establish parity in the service array and reimbursement rates for treating youth with a primary mental health disorder diagnosis and those with a primary diagnosis of substance use disorder (SUD).</li>
<li>Explore opportunities for SAT-ED treatment providers to be reimbursed at an enhanced rate for Comprehensive Adolescent Severity Inventory (CASI) assessment and Multidimensional Family Therapy (MDFT) services.</li>
<li>Continue to develop a strong partnership with Medicaid Enterprise and Magellan Health Services to complete the financial mapping process and use findings.</li>
<li>Submit a draft financial map by the end of June 2014.</li>
<li>Recruit a staff person from the Department of Human Services who is authorized to participate in the financial mapping planning and in its execution.</li>
<li>Develop outcomes that will demonstrate the change in financial strategies and associated policies that directly result from the financial mapping workgroup.</li>
<li>Ensure IDHP and the SAT-ED providers engage in followup and coordinated work with Magellan Health Services to determine funding ability and flexibility within current payment codes for MDFT reimbursement.
<li>Ensure treatment providers engage Magellan Health Services in a discussion to negotiate reimbursement strategies for MDFT provision. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul></div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Workforce Development	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The April 2014 Governor’s Conference on Substance Abuse included a session on adolescent SUD treatment and the distribution of a workforce survey. </li>
<li>The SAT-ED initiative held two Webinars on cultural competency.</li>
<li>SAT-ED stakeholders and staff recognize the need to develop adolescent-specific SUD education for inclusion in behavioral health curricula for bachelor’s degrees and master’s degrees.</li>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Current licensing and certification agency standards are not specific for the delivery of adolescent SUD treatment.</li>
<li>Adolescent-specific SUD treatment training initiatives are not currently available.</li>
<li>Cross-disciplinary adolescent SUD training does not exist for partner agencies that include child welfare, juvenile justice, school services, medical, mental health, and law enforcement staffs.</li>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
<li>Use IDPH’s positioning as the entity responsible for professional licensing to improve adolescent SUD treatment workforce standards, particularly among licensed professional who have not had sufficient SUD training and education.</li>
<li>Enhance education of Iowa’s behavioral health workforce about Health Resources and Services Administration student loan programs for qualified health care professionals.</li>
<li>Develop and coordinate presentations of MDFT and youth and family panels on the agendas of child- and youth-serving Governor’s and professional conferences.</li>
<li>As IDPH develops MDFT presentations for conferences across Iowa, work collaboratively with youth and family panelists on the conference agendas.</li>
<li>Continue to develop and implement a comprehensive sustainable multiyear workforce training dissemination plan.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation of Evidence-Based Practices	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The two SAT-ED treatment provider sites demonstrated strong leadership in their commitment to provide Multidimensional Family Therapy (MDFT) to youth and families as the new treatment-as-usual approach.</li>
<li>The two sites clearly articulated the transformational effect of MDFT on their agencies, staffs, and family clients. The sites have changed their practices, and they do not want to go back to business as usual.</li>
<li>The two provider sites proactively share their clinical expertise and motivate others throughout the State.</li>
<li>The SAT-ED team and the two provider sites have developed a mentoring model to expand the use of the MDFT evidence-based practice (EBP) to the SAT-ED expansion sites.</li>
<li>The Comprehensive Adolescent Severity Inventory (CASI) assessment tool is compatible with MDFT.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li> The SAT-ED providers expressed little likelihood that they would sustain the CASI assessment after SAT-ED funding ends.</li>
<li> The SAT-ED team and treatment sites shared a need to develop fiscal payment strategies to sustain the practice of MDFT after the award.</li>
<li> A high rate of clinician turnover, lack of data, and small client sample size when assessing client outcomes combine to diminish the sustainability of the MDFT model.</li>
<li> The intensity of MDFT means clinicians manage a smaller-than-usual caseload--reducing productivity and increasing treatment costs.</li>
<li> IDPH recognizes the need to develop in-home adolescent SUD treatment service options and school-based SUD treatment.</li>
<li> Few continuing care and recovery support services are available to youth and families after formal treatment ends.</li>
<li> Iowa’s ATR services are underused for adolescents. </li>
<li> Iowa’s treatment providers are not at the table to develop new health care financing.</li>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
<li>Continue the collaboration among IDPH and the two SAT-ED treatment providers on developing the business case model through their TA request.</li>
<li> Continue the collaboration among IDPH and the SAT-ED treatment providers to reduce barriers for youth to receive Access to Recovery (ATR) resources.</li>
<li>Provide Iowa’s adolescent SUD treatment providers with additional preparation to adapt and thrive in the changing behavioral health care environment. Include activities that identify the funding and regulatory structural changes needed to accommodate a seamless service continuum that includes step-up and step-down levels of care. Iowa is encouraged to maximize the this award's opportunities and consider developing a conceptual model/framework for the ideal Iowa adolescent SUD treatment and recovery service delivery system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Need for Technical Assistance Requests</b>
  <ul>
  <li>If additional assistance is needed, request TA on developing the business case model. </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Family and Youth Involvement	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> Iowa’s SAT-ED staff recruited parents and youth for the site visit who were willing to share their personal stories with the site visit team.</li>
<li>Parents reported positive experiences participating in MDFT.</li>
<li> Parents indicated that their youth’s eligibility for Medicaid was an important factor in accessing SUD treatment.</li>
<li>The State has recognized the need to develop resources and collaborative processes for all Iowa parents whose youth need referral, treatment, and recovery services and has requested technical assistance to work with the National Family Dialogue for this purpose.</li>
<li> Youth shared their achievements in early remission. </li>
<li>Services that youth felt helped them included:
	<ul>
<li>A safe place to live where they can learn life skills</li>
<li>Peer support</li>
<li>A life-changing experience with a foster mother who offers unconditional support</li>
<li>Mutual-support groups</li>
<li>A choice in accepting visitors and developing healthful adult relationships</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Iowa’s parents do not have centralized access to information to help them navigate adolescent SUD referral, treatment, and recovery services.</li>
<li>There are no parent-to-parent peer support structures or continuing care and recovery services after formal treatment ends.</li>
<li>Teachers, child welfare workers, juvenile justice officials, physicians, nurses, and faith- and community-based organizations are not sufficiently informed about adolescent SUD treatment and recovery and are not sensitive to the complexity of this health care issue.</li>
<li>Transportation to treatment providers is a challenge in Iowa’s rural communities.</li>
<li> Iowa’s youth face cultural challenges when seeking and maintaining recovery in rural communities.</li>
<li>Youth reported many attempts to reach out for assistance with their SUDs from child-serving systems, including schools, to no avail. They reported staff from these systems either did not recognize their substance use issues or chose not to help them.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li> Add a parent page to the Families in Focus Web site with information on accessing adolescent SUD treatment and recovery services and phone numbers.
 <li>Develop an expanded continuing care recovery model.</li>
 <li>Develop formal structures to hear from parents and youth about their needs and involve them in developing meaningful policy solutions. Use the TA opportunity with the National Family Dialogue to assist parents.</li>
 <li>Address the request from youth to administer drug screens to parents before placing a removed youth back in the home or permitting home visitations.</li>
 <li>Address the request from youth that every middle school and high school have an onsite certified SUD counselor.</li>
 <li>Increase options available to youth to access continuing care and recovery services and supports after formal treatment ends.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Evaluation	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>IDPH and the SAT-ED evaluation team have collaborative working relationships.</li>
<li>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration approved carryover funding to expand the evaluation contract to include the evaluation of infrastructure activities.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li> A plan needs to be developed to evaluate infrastructure activities and outcomes. </li>
<li>There is a continuing need to maintain the distinction between implementation and evaluation.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li>  Ensure evaluators continue to obtain information for the fiscal pilot report and the bi-annual report while developing the infrastructure data plan.</li>
<li>Develop an infrastructure plan and send it to Ruby Neville, CSAT Grants Project Officer, by Monday, May 19.</li>
<li>Encourage evaluators to review the SAT-ED Webinar on evaluation and to request a conference call with evaluation presenters from other SAT-ED States.

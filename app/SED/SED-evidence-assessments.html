<h3 class="clearfix">About These Evidence-Based Assessments</h3>
<h4><a href="http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/AssessingAlcohol/InstrumentPDFs/21_CASI.pdf" target="_blank">CASI<span class="icon--external"></span></a>
</h4>
<p>The <b>Comprehensive Adolescent Severity Inventory (CASI)</b> is a comprehensive, semi-structured, clinical assessment and outcomes interview. It is comprised of 10 independent modules, each incorporating objective, focused, and concrete questions. Modules include health, family, stressful life events, legal status, sexual behavior, AOD use, mental health functioning, peer relationships, education, and use of free time. Questions are formatted to identify whether certain behaviors have ever occurred regularly, how old the adolescent was when they first occurred regularly, and whether they occurred regularly during the past year (past month and other 11 months). Each module assesses whether the adolescent acknowledges the presence of problems and obtains his/her rating of discomfort. The CASI also includes questions designed to assess the strength-base of the youth.</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.gaincc.org/index.cfm?pageID=49" target="_blank">GAIN-I Full<span class="icon--external"></span></a>
</h4>
<p>The <b>Global Appraisal of Individual Needs Initial (GAIN-I) Full</b> is designed to collect as much information in about 1.5 to 2.5 hours on the participant\'s first day of treatment, as would often be collected in their first few months of treatment in many programs. The GAIN-I Full is also available in Spanish (Valoraci√≥n Global de Necesidades Individuales Inicial or VGNI-I) and French (Evaluation Globale des Besoins Individuels or EGBI). The Spanish version was translated by a multilingual, multicultural translation workgroup for use with Spanish-speaking individuals in the United States. The French version was translated by a Quebec-based multilingual translation workgroup for use with French-speaking individuals in Quebec, Canada.</p>


<h4><a href="http://www.gaincc.org/index.cfm?pageID=49" target="_blank">GAIN-I Lite<span class="icon--external"></span></a>
</h4>
<p>The <b>Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN-I) Lite</b> is designed to collect as much information in about an hour as many programs collect in a participant\'s first few months of treatment. The GAIN-I Lite is a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment designed to support clinical diagnosis, placement, treatment planning, performance monitoring, program planning and economic analysis and to meet some common standards and reporting requirements. It includes a majority of the items in the 35-minute GAIN-Q3-Standard plus the minimum necessary additional items for more detailed diagnoses and ASAM placement dimensions.</p>


<h4><a href="http://www.gaincc.org/index.cfm?pageID=49" target="_blank">GAIN-Q3<span class="icon--external"></span></a></h4>
<p>The <b>Global Appraisal of Individual Needs Q3 (GAIN-Q3)</b> is a brief, 20-45 minute assessment used to identify and address a wide range of problems among adolescents and adults in clinical and general populations. As a clinical tool, the GAIN-Q3 is designed for use by personnel in diverse settings that include employee assistance programs, student assistance programs, health clinics, juvenile justice, criminal justice, child welfare, mental health, and substance abuse treatment programs.</p>




<h4><a href="http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/AssessingAlcohol/InstrumentPDFs/70_T-ASI.pdf" target="_blank">T-ASI<span class="icon--external"></span></a></h4>
<p>The <b>Teen Addiction Severity Index (TASI)</b> is a semi-structured interview that was developed to fill the need for a reliable, valid, and standardized instrument for a periodic evaluation of adolescent substance abuse. The T-ASI uses a multidimensional approach of assessment as an age-appropriate modification of the Addiction Severity Index. It yields 70 ratings in seven domains: chemical (substance) use, school status, employment/support status, family relations, peer/social relationships, legal status, and psychiatric status.</p>

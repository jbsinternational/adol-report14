    <div id="accordion-container">
<h3 class="accordion-header">Awardee Leadership	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Division of Alcholism and Substance Abuse (DASA) is committed to continue moving toward an organizational structure that integrates substance use and mental health program areas. </li>
<li>The IL SAT-ED appears to have a cohesive team.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The SAT-ED director dedicates a little less than 50 percent of time to work on the SAT-ED initiative and is assisted by a SAT-ED manager who dedicates 50 percent of her time.</li>
<li>The SAT-ED team’s non-SAT-ED responsibilities are vast and involve competing priorities that may become further elevated if the merger between DASA and the Department of Mental Health (DMH) is effectuated and as Medicaid reform accelerates.</li>
<li>Multiple SAT-ED requirements must be addressed concurrently over the next 15 months, and the current staffing pattern does not appear to support this level of effort.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b> </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
<ul>
<li>The Division of Alcholism and Substance Abuse (DASA) may want to review the many SAT-ED tasks, clearly assign responsibility for timely completion to members of the SAT-ED team, and augment SAT-ED staffing if needed to ensure all tasks are completed in a manner that fosters sustainability after the SAT-ED award ends. </li>
<li>The SAT-ED initiative could benefit from more leadership involvement from the SSA.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>

</div> 
     
<h3 class="accordion-header">Interagency Collaboration	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>

<li>The IL SAT-ED interagency council has most of its required members and several signed memoranda of understanding.</li>
<li>The IL SAT-ED also has additional members such as for the certification board and Co-Occurring Center of Excellence, the SAT-ED providers, prevention, and both substance use and mental health provider associations.</li>
<li>The council has a subcommittee structure to address the required financial mapping and workforce development SAT-ED activities.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The council is missing a youth representative and a public health representative. </li>
<li>The juvenile justice representative left and was replaced; however, the new representative is not fully oriented to the SAT-ED initiative.</li>
<li>Representatives from the child-serving agencies are at uneven leadership levels.</li>
<li>The pathway between the SAT-ED steering committee and the higher level policy decisionmakers is not clear.</li>
<li>The level of SAT-ED interagency council participation ranges from deputy directors and bureau chiefs to lower level staff, but none is at the SSA level.</li>
<li>The SAT-ED initiative does not appear to be focused on systemic policy change or SAT-ED sustainability.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
     <li>Add primary youth and family SUD representation and a health representative to the council. </li>
<li>Consider adding housing authority and disability council representation on the interagency council.</li> 
<li>DASA might consider leveraging a current housing initiative to benefit the SAT-ED families who need housing. </li>
<li>Develop a formal mechanism to ensure SAT-ED issues are formally channeled to the SAT-ED interagency council agenda. </li>
<li>Review the mechanisms the council can use to facilitate policy change across child-serving agencies.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div> 

<h3 class="accordion-header">Financing and Financial Mapping	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The grantee plans to start up the second ETSU site in Johnson City by September 1, 2012.</li>
<li>Implementation is adapted to the unique context of each site.</li>
<li>The grantee is implementing SBIRT as part of the ANG members' annual heath readiness assessment.</li>
<li>The grantee has set aside additional State funds to further support its SBIRT/National Guard project.</li>
<li>SBIRT billing codes have been activated in Tennessee.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>SAT-ED providers are serving large numbers of undocumented families who are not Medicaid enrolled, potentially creating significant funding challenges as non-Medicaid funding sources become scarcer.</li>
<li>Legacy programs in Illinois may have a more robust benefit package.</li>
<li>Current reimbursement rates do not support evidence-based practice (EBP) implementations.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
<li>Continue efforts to establish rates that support evidence-based practices (EBPs) and achieve equity in benefit design and services reimbursement. </li>
<li>Ensure the managed care organization contracts support the delivery of EBP treatment with fidelity to the model, continuing care, and recovery services and supports.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Workforce Development	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>DASA has a SAT-ED workforce dissemination plan informed by results from Dual Diagnosis Capability in Addiction Treatment assessments from well-established youth providers, IL SAC, youth endorsement requirements, and other key informants.</li>
<li>DASA has a contract in place with Heartland to assist with the development and implementation of DASA’s SAT-ED workforce dissemination plan.</li>
<li>DASA’s SAT-ED workforce dissemination plan includes formats such as workshops, conferences, Webinars, and TA. </li>
<li>DASA’s SAT-ED initiative has undertaken some training of the workforce with staff of other child-serving agencies and has a plan to obtain more specific information on training needs and delivery.</li>
<li>The SAT-ED initiative has identified subject matter experts to carry out several other training initiatives in three regions within Illinois (the other two regions will join training events in one of the three regions).</li>
<li>DASA SAT-ED EBP workforce training is underway in region 1, and DASA has a plan to spread training for its A-CRA ACC expansion to other provider sites in each of its remaining four regions.</li>
<li>The SAT-ED sites have completed all Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN) training certification, and most of the staff have completed A-CRA certification.</li>
<li>The Illinois Certification Board created an adolescent treatment endorsement under the SAC award, which continues today with 184 adolescent treatment endorsements in place. In addition to basic certification, clinicians providing substance use disorder (SUD) treatment for youth must have a minimum of 10 hours of adolescent-specific training.</li>
<li>The Illinois Certification Board offers two addiction/mental health conferences a year, and both have adolescent tracks and 15 accredited training programs throughout the state. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>DASA has not entered all training event data in the Government Performance and Results Act (GRPA) system.</li>
<li>DASA’s SAT-ED EBP expansion site dissemination plan does not currently include GAIN EBP training.</li>
<li>DASA has not had significant attendance for its SAT-ED Webinars and is in the process of addressing the attendance issues and developing remedies.</li>
<li>The DASA SAT-ED workforce dissemination plan does not have a sufficient focus on basic addiction training.</li>
<li>The DASA SAT-ED workforce dissemination plan does not include a sufficient focus on the specific needs of child-serving agencies.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Continue the process of entering training Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) data in the system.</li>
<li>Work with Illinois’ Government Project Officer to identify a way to disseminate the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN)evidence-based practice to other provider sites.</li>
<li>Incorporate appropriate Illinois Credentialing Board trainings in the SAT-ED workforce dissemination plan.</li>
<li>Enhance training opportunities in the basics of child development and addiction (e.g., trauma, neuroscience, family dynamics).</li>
<li>Ensure other child-serving agency partners have basics in addiction such as screening and referral processes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation of Evidence-Based Practices	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The sites expressed positive experiences with the Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA) Assertive Continuing Care (ACC) EBP.</li>
<li>Both sites have strong clinical supervisors who have remained constant.</li>
<li>The SAT-ED sites have completed 155 intakes to date.</li>
<li>SAT-ED provider sites participate in a weekly call with the SAT-ED State management team to explore challenges and find solutions.</li>
<li>SAT-ED sites are using creative approaches to reach youth and families, including using faith-based partners, schools, and other community partners.</li>
<li>The SAT-ED team and provider sites recognized a need to improve their parent engagement.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li> SAT-ED providers expressed significant concerns with the full GAIN assessment instrument related to its length and the associated impact on client engagement.</li>
<li> SAT-ED providers have experienced a significant amount of staff turnover. </li>
<li> One site is lagging a bit behind on credentialing for the EBPs because of the excessively high rate of staff turnover.</li>
<li> Significant differences exist between the SAT-ED provider sites’ client completion rates (60 percent to 10 percent, respectively), the latter being at unacceptable levels.</li>
<li> Both sites expressed a need for enhanced client engagement and retention.</li>
<li> The youth and families participating in SAT-ED have problems and needs that greatly exceed the scope of A-CRA ACC (e.g., basic needs for food and safe housing, gang violence and other safety challenges, parents in prison or being involved with substances).</li>
<li> The Chestnut requirement that SAT-ED sites obtain parental consent is a barrier to treatment enrollment.</li>
<li> There is an appearance of conflict of interest with Chestnut/Lighthouse collecting the client followup data.</li>
<li> There is not sufficient screening for developmental disabilities (e.g., dyslexia, traumatic brain injury, autism).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
<li>DASA can explore with Chestnut switching to the GAIN Q-3 assessment instrument.</li>
<li>Continue to receive technical assistance on youth and family engagement and retention.</li>
<li>Explore opportunities to incentivize staff for longevity to maintain A-CRA certified staff.</li>
<li>Explore with Chestnut/Lighthouse alternatives to their parent consent requirements.</li>
<li>Explore with Chestnut the data collection and followup role.</li>
<li>Explore opportunities to link youth and families to other needed services as part of necessary recovery support.</li>
<li>DASA might consider using SAT-ED funds to hire outreach staff more indigenous to the community and populations to increase enrollment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Family and Youth Involvement	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li> IL SAT-ED arranged for interviews with parents and youth from the SAT-ED providers who shared their SUD treatment experiences, which can greatly inform enhancements to the Illinois adolescent treatment system.</li>
<li> One SAT-ED provider has strong family involvement.</li>
<li> Parents and youth interviewed agreed to participate in mechanisms to strengthen the youth and family voice in treatment improvement processes.</li>
<li> Both parents and youth were uniformly positive about their A-CRA experiences.</li>
<li> Illinois is working to create a family support organization and family resource centers in Illinois to strengthen and support the parent voice.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>There is no formal family support organization in Illinois to provide the parent voice.</li>
<li>One SAT-ED provider has significant challenges obtaining family support.</li>
<li>Families reported the need for more family support, including family-to-family support.</li>
<li>Parents and youth reported the need for more youth-focused activities (prosocial activities), including access to sports, especially since schools have closed (four in one area alone). Some of the school closings put rival gangs that had been in separate schools into the same school.</li>
<li>Parents reported not having any idea about the pathway to access SUD treatment. One parent had to access SUD treatment via juvenile justice involvement.</li>
<li>There are transportation barriers and a need for greater access to services closer to home. </li>
<li>Families identified several other family issues with substance abuse among other family members and housing issues that were not currently being addressed by the SAT-ED programs.</li>
<li>DASA is behind on its plan to develop a family resource center and is halfway through the SAT-ED award period. Staff are learning they may not have allocated enough seed money ($50,000) to get one underway.</li>
<li>DASA and much of the Illinois treatment system has historically viewed family involvement as a collateral contact rather than embracing family as key focus of treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
<li> Illinois needs a structure to support parents and youth with SUD issues. </li>
<li>DASA can work with the SAT-ED providers to ensure every family member needing treatment or other resources gets linked to them.</li>
<li>DASA could consider implementing a family peer navigator approach to increase family engagement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Evaluation	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The SAT-ED sites are on target with their GPRA admission targets and exceed their followup targets.
<li>DASA has outstanding client evaluation data.
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>There does not appear to be a statewide infrastructure evaluation plan.</li>
<li>The SAT-ED evaluation does not currently include sufficient State infrastructure evaluation measures.</li>
<li>There is a need to establish baseline data and to continue to collect data for the infrastructure measures.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
<li>The SAT-ED evaluation team will need to develop and implement a SAT-ED infrastructure evaluation plan and submit it to the GPO by July 15, 2014.</li>
<li>A firewall is needed between the EBP implementers and the evaluators.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

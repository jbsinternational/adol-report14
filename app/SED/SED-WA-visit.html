    <div id="accordion-container">
<h3 class="accordion-header">Awardee Leadership	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li> The Washington State SAT-ED project director is an experienced treatment services administrator with professional credibility. She also served for a time as the lead for Washington’s SAC grant.  </li>
<li> The Washington State SAT-ED initiative is supported by a contractual agreement with Washington State University to host the State’s Youth ‘N Action (YNA) chapter, with the aim of increasing youth involvement in the SAT-ED initiative. </li>
<li> The passing of Senate Bill 6312 is intended to support substance use disorder (SUD) and mental health disorder services equitably in the Washington Division of Behavioral Health and Recovery (DBHR) and position Washington State’s behavioral health care organization as a best practice managed care system. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> It is important for single State authority (SSA) leadership to have ongoing direct involvement in SAT-ED activities. </li>
  <li> The SAT-ED staffing pattern may need to be augmented to accomplish the scope of work for the SAT-ED initiative.   </li>
  <li> DBHR leadership could benefit from continued orientation to the SAT-ED requirements. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Review and augment current SAT-ED leadership staff.</li>
      <li> Washington State could use the regional, State, and local Family, Youth and System Partner Round Table (FYSPRT) infrastructure to further integrate SUD services into the behavioral health treatment and recovery system.  </li>
      <li> Washington’s Division of Behavioral Health and Recovery (DBHR) and FYSPRT could benefit from continued orientation to and integration of the SAT-ED goals, objectives, and required activities.  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
</div> 
     
<h3 class="accordion-header">Interagency Collaboration	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>  Washington State has all the required partners and memorandums of understanding in place to support meaningful interagency collaboration.  </li>
<li> The Family, Youth and System Partner Round Table (FYSPRT) council is an authentic structure that is inclusive of family and youth presence and voice.  </li>
<li>FYSPRT representatives are receptive and aware of the need to expand the SUD focus in the State’s behavioral health care system. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li> Substance use disorder treatment, continuing care, and recovery supports are not fully integrated or prevalent in the Washington State behavioral health care system.  
<li> There is no visible high-level State agency leadership within the FYSPRT structure. 
<li> There is a need to infuse youth SUD issues and SAT-ED activities throughout the entire FYSPRT system. 
<li>It is essential to orient FYSPRT to all required SAT-ED activities.  
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li> Work to infuse substance use disorder (SUD) issues throughout the FYSRPT structure and agenda. </li>
      <li> Increase representation at the FYSPRT by youth and families with lived SUD experiences. </li>
      <li> Develop a structured orientation to the SAT-ED award that includes an overview of workplan deliverables.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div> 

<h3 class="accordion-header">Financing and Financial Mapping	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul><li> Washington has a tremendous opportunity to develop a gold standard SUD and mental health system with the confluence of Senate Bill 6312, the TR lawsuit settlement, and marijuana taxation resources.   </li>
  <li> Medicaid is a fully participating partner with payment protocols in place for recovery supports.  </li>
  <li> Washington has a continuing systems of care (SOC) award that further supports the system’s ability to provide SUD and mental health treatment. </li>
  <li> There was a well-represented and engaged cross-agency group at the financial mapping discussion. </li>
  <li> DBHR has made significant progress in identifying SUD expenditures.  </li>
  <li> DBHR is working collaboratively with SOC staff on financial mapping. </li>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li> The promulgation of Senate Bill 6312 and subsequent implementation of the new managed care entity are likely to create system instability and further challenge the fragility of the SUD system integration.  </li>
<li> The recent TR et al. v. Dreyfus settlement requires system attention that could further preclude a focus on access to quality SUD treatment and recovery services.  </li>
<li> The implications of the TR settlement for the behavioral health care system and resources available for youth with a primary SUD require monitoring. </li>
<li> The current behavioral health billing process is bifurcated and includes a county governance system which regulates pay structures independently.  </li>
<li> County resources are not included in the financial mapping process. </li>
<li> Expenditure data from the public health authority are not included in the current financial mapping process.  </li>
<li> Washington does not have a reimbursement methodology for peer recovery supports for adolescents with SUD.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li>Continue SAT-ED project director involvement in the SUD-focused process with DBHR support.</li>
      <li> Consider including county billing information in DBHR’s financial mapping process. </li>
      <li> Inform the Department of Public Health of the SAT-ED award and financial mapping requirements and request the department’s involvement in the financial mapping process.     </li>
      <li> Develop DBHR system protocols and policies to recognize peer recovery supports as a Medicaid-reimbursable treatment service. </li>
      <li> Continue the DBHR financial mapping process. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Workforce Development	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> Washington State has implemented a policy easement to further increase professional capacity to serve youth with SUDs. </li>
  <li> DBHR has an existing collaborative relationship with Portland State University and Washington State University to create professional development opportunities and training. </li>
  <li> DBHR uses surveys to solicit feedback from practitioners; these data directly inform workforce development efforts.  </li>
  <li> DBHR uses Webinars to promote professional development through knowledge exposure training across child-serving agencies and key stakeholders.  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> DBHR does not yet have a complete SAT-ED workforce dissemination plan in place. </li>
  <li> There is a need for a formalized curriculum for the clinical workforce and allied agency staff serving youth with SUDs and their families.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop and implement a SAT-ED workforce dissemination plan. </li>
      <li> Develop a training curriculum for the allied child-serving agencies in their areas of expertise to support youth with SUDs. </li>
      <li> Train mental health staff in SUD treatment and recovery support per the new WAC easement. </li>
      <li> Integrate diagnosis, symptom recognition, and appropriate treatment modalities for co-occurring mental health disorders into SUD treatment protocols.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
    <li><b>Need for Technical Assistance Request</b>    
      <ul>
        <li>DBHR requested technical assistance from SAMHSA on the NIATx model of continuous quality improvement in treatment access and retention of treatment gains.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation of Evidence-Based Practices	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> Both provider sites have clinicians who are fully certified in the selected evidence-based practice (EBP) and assessment tool and have met their Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) targets. </li>
  <li> Clinical and support personnel appear committed to providing holistic treatment services and recovery support to youth with SUDs.  </li>
  <li> Clinical and support personnel identify and recognize the value added by recovery supports. </li>
  <li> Each current Washington State treatment site has the benefit of a recovery support coordinator to identify and provide meaningful recovery supports to youth with SUDs.   </li>
  <li> Clinical personnel are engaged and comfortable with the use of the EBP and employ the EBP as an effective treatment strategy for youth experiencing a SUD. </li>
  <li> Staff appreciated the data available from the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN), which is useful in the clinical assessment and treatment of youth with SUDs. </li>
  <li> Clinical personnel create adaptive strategies appropriate for adolescent development to facilitate the administration of the GAIN. </li>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The move to covering more youth through Medicaid has adversely affected providers because Medicaid rates are lower than the rates paid using block grant or State funds.  </li>
<li> It is unclear how the Washington State behavioral health system identifies and treats youth with SUDs or co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders.  </li>
<li> The EBP dissemination plan for SAT-ED year 2 expansion treatment sites is not clear about ensuring fidelity to the model.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li>Develop a systematic approach to support Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA) certification.</li>
      <li> Develop a plan to spread the evidence-based practices (EBPs) to year 2 expansion sites and ensure EBP fidelity for years 2 and 3.  </li>
      <li> Recheck the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN) version used for adolescent applicability. </li>
      <li> DBHR has more stringent requirements for its adolescent intensive outpatient program than required by the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), potentially creating unintended access and retention barriers. </li>
      <li> Continue to develop recovery supports appropriate for youth with SUDs.  </li>
      <li> Develop a community resource network to sustain recovery supports.  </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  <li><b>Information Requested</b>  
    <ul>
      <li> Develop a systematic approach to support A-CRA certification.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Family and Youth Involvement	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> Washington State has a well-developed mental health infrastructure through the systems of care (SOC) grant, upon which the SAT-ED team is building to integrate a voice for youth and families experiencing SUDs.   </li>
  <li> An identified group of parents of youth with SUDs articulate their needs and concerns on behalf of themselves and their children in the absence of a structured entity. </li>
  <li> YNA is an organized, well-led, and relevant advocacy and recovery support organization for youth experiencing SUDs. </li>
  <li> YNA has a committed vision for system enhancement.   </li>
  <li> YNA is supported and hosted by Washington State University.  </li>
  <li> YNA is working to develop an organized, statewide grassroots movement to support youth with SUDs and co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders.  </li>
  <li> YNA is working to develop innovative recovery support services for youth experiencing SUDs.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul><li>Families and youth with primary SUDs have no system-supported structures for recovery supports.    </li>
  <li>YNA's SUD focus appears to be primarily supported by the SAT-ED award; leaders expressed concerns about organizational stability after the SAT-ED award ends.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li> Develop and support a statewide, structured family organization for youth with SUDs.  </li>
      <li> Provide a professional mentor with SUD experience for Youth ‘N Action (YNA) leadership to evolve the organization and ensure sustainability of a SUD focus. </li>
      <li> Help to develop the future peer support leaders for youth with SUDs. </li>
      <li> Plan a sustainable system of support for YNA beyond SAT-ED award funding. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>

  <li> Washington State has a robust quasi-experimental research design at the site level.  </li>
  <li> Washington State has an integrated and content-rich cross-agency data set to support the SAT-ED initiative evaluation.</li>
  <li> The evaluation design uses surveys to solicit input from key stakeholders. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>There are no relevant and specific measures to evaluate State-level infrastructure change (e.g., interagency collaboration, financing, workforce development, youth and family involvement, policy changes). </li>
<li> There is an inability to separate out the contribution of recovery supports to client outcomes. </li>
<li>There is no measure that ensures the sites are adhering to the EBP model's fidelity. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>  
    <ul>

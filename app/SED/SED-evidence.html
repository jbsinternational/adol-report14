<h4><a href="http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/ViewIntervention.aspx?id=41" target="_blank">A-CRA<span class="icon--external"></span></a></h4>
<p><b>Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA)</b> to alcohol and substance use treatment is a behavioral intervention that seeks to replace environmental contingencies that have supported alcohol or drug use with prosocial activities and behaviors that support recovery. This outpatient program targets youth 12 to 22 years old with DSM-IV cannabis, alcohol, and/or other substance use disorders. A-CRA includes guidelines for three types of sessions: adolescents alone, parents/caregivers alone, and adolescents and parents/caregivers together. According to the adolescent's needs and self-assessment of happiness in multiple areas of functioning, therapists choose from among 17 A-CRA procedures that address, for example, problem-solving skills to cope with day-to-day stressors, communication skills, and active participation in prosocial activities with the goal of improving life satisfaction and eliminating alcohol and substance use problems. Role-playing/behavioral rehearsal is a critical component of the skills training used in A-CRA, particularly for the acquisition of better communication and relapse prevention skills. Homework between sessions consists of practicing skills learned during sessions and participating in prosocial leisure&nbsp;activities.</p>  




<h4><a href="http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/ViewIntervention.aspx?id=41" target="_blank">A-CRA/ACC<span class="icon--external"></span></a></h4>
<p><b>Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA)</b> to alcohol and substance use treatment is a behavioral intervention that seeks to replace environmental contingencies that have supported alcohol or drug use with prosocial activities and behaviors that support recovery. This outpatient program targets youth 12 to 22 years old with DSM-IV cannabis, alcohol, and/or other substance use disorders. A-CRA includes guidelines for three types of sessions: adolescents alone, parents/caregivers alone, and adolescents and parents/caregivers together.

Role-playing/behavioral rehearsal is a critical component of the skills training used in A-CRA, particularly for the acquisition of better communication and relapse prevention skills. Homework between sessions consists of practicing skills learned during sessions and participating in prosocial leisure activities.</p><p>A-CRA has been adapted for use with <b>Assertive Continuing Care (ACC)</b>, which provides home visits to youth following residential treatment for alcohol and/or other substance dependence. It also has been adapted for use in a drop-in center for street-living, homeless youth to reduce substance use, increase social stability, and improve physical and mental health. These adaptations are reviewed in this&nbsp;summary.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15618940" target="_blank">ICT<span class="icon--external"></span></a></h4>
<p><b>Integrated Co-Occurring Treatment (ICT) </b>requires both an understanding of mental illness and addiction and the means to integrate and modify the traditional treatment approaches in both the mental health and addiction treatment fields. There is strong evidence to support the efficacy and effectiveness of integrated treatment in this population. All mental health clinicians should become experienced and skilled in the core psychotherapy approaches to treating substance use disorders, including motivational enhancement therapy, relapse prevention (cognitive-behavioral therapy), and 12-step facilitation. In addition, integrated treatment includes integrating medications for both addiction and mental illness with the behavioral therapies and other psychosocial interventions.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/ViewIntervention.aspx?id=16" target="_blank">MDFT<span class="icon--external"></span></a></h4>
<p><b>Multidimensional Family Therapy (MDFT)</b> encompasses treatment within four areas: including the individual adolescent, the adolescentâ€™s family members as individuals, the family unit, and how the family unit interacts with the social environment. Critical components of the program include community service, community collaboration, parent training, school collaboration, skill development, substance abuse/prevention education, and therapy. If youth are involved with the court, the court system may be involved as well.</p>






<h4><a href="http://nrepp.samhsa.gov/ViewIntervention.aspx?id=31" target="_blank">MET/CBT<span class="icon--external"></span></a></h4>
<p><b>Family Support Network (FSN)</b> is an outpatient substance abuse treatment program targeting youth ages 10-18 years. FSN includes a family component along with a 12-session, adolescent-focused cognitive behavioral therapy--called Motivational Enhancement Therapy/Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MET/CBT12)--and case management. The family component attempts to engage adolescents and their parents in a joint commitment to the treatment and recovery process. It establishes a support system, encourages family communication, and teaches parents behavioral management skills with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of family interrelationships. The family component includes:<ul><li>Six biweekly, multifamily education meetings addressing teen beliefs, adolescent development, adolescent drug use patterns, drugs and adolescents, the recovery process, and family management issues such as boundaries, parental discipline, and communication</li><li>Four monthly home visits to reinforce the family's commitment to treatment and help the adolescent and his or her family individualize the skills they learned.</li></ul></p><p>The MET/CBT12 component provides 2 individual sessions of MET that explore and resolve the youth's ambivalence about changing substance abuse behaviors and 10 group sessions of CBT that teach youth specific cognitive behavioral skills. These skills include refusing cannabis, problem solving, anger awareness and management, dealing with criticism, managing depression, coping with cravings, managing thoughts about marijuana, planning for emergencies, building a better social network, engaging in activities unrelated to drug use, and coping with&nbsp;relapse. </p>  

                             
<h4><a href="http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/ViewIntervention.aspx?id=159" target="_blank">Seven Challenges<span class="icon--external"></span></a></h4>
<p><b>The Seven Challenges (7C)</b> program focuses on trust and relationship building as primary motivators for change. Cognitive and emotional aspects of decision making are used to help adolescents think through their decisions about alcohol and drugs. Young people also are encouraged to use a Health-Decision Model, which involves evaluating their choices with regard to health consequences. The 7C program is designed specifically for adolescents with drug problems, to motivate a decision and commitment to change and to support success in implementing the desired changes. The program simultaneously helps young people address their drug problems as well as their co-occurring life skill deficits, situational problems, and psychological problems. The Challenges provide a framework for helping youth think through their own decisions about their lives and their use of alcohol and other drugs. Counselors using 7C teach youth to identify and work on the issues most relevant to them. In sessions, as youth discuss the issues that matter most, counselors seamlessly integrate the Challenges as part of the&nbsp;conversation.</p>

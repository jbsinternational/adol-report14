    <div id="accordion-container">
<h3 class="accordion-header">Awardee Leadership	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Having responsibility for both substance use and mental disorder treatment systems positions the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (ODMHSAS) well for planning and delivering substance use disorder (SUD) treatment and SUD and co-occurring mental disorder services for adolescents. </li>
<li> ODMHSAS’s responsibility for management of behavioral health Medicaid funding and policy development positions it well for the SAT-ED award. </li>
<li> Oklahoma uses its SAT-ED infrastructure funds to support a full-time SAT-ED coordinator and a part-time (20 percent) internal evaluation staff member. </li>
<li> Oklahoma’s SAT-ED team appears very knowledgeable about adolescents with SUD. </li>
<li> Work on previous and other current behavioral health awards supports Oklahoma’s implementation of its SAT-ED award.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Adolescent behavioral health services in Oklahoma are limited. Decades of underfunding and lack of parity for substance use and mental disorder services have contributed to Oklahoma’s limited capacity to serve only approximately one-third of youth in need of SUD treatment.  </li>
  <li> Multiple severe tornadoes affected SAT-ED implementation as ODMHSAS leadership was temporarily reassigned.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li>Augment the SAT-ED initiative's current staffing pattern to accomplish multiple simultaneous tasks.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
</div> 
     
<h3 class="accordion-header">Interagency Collaboration	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>ODMHSAS pulled together an initial SAT-ED steering committee as it was developing its SAT-ED grant application. Committee members include representatives from the Office of Juvenile Affairs (OJA), Department of Human Services (DHS), Parents Helping Parents, and a Native American clinic. The committee meets monthly. </li>
<li> The initial SAT-ED steering committee reports to the Children’s State Advisory Workgroup comprising child-serving agency managers. Oklahoma also has a high-level leadership group called Partnership for Children’s Behavioral Health. In 2009, all eight leaders developed a memorandum of understanding (MOU). ODMHSAS staff are trying to add the SAT-ED requirements to the MOU. </li>
<li> The SAT-ED steering committee members expressed an interest in identifying a uniform screening and assessment tool. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>ODMHSAS’ SAT-ED interagency steering committee does not include a public health representative or a youth member. Both are required by the SAT-ED award. 
<li> External (across agency) and internal (intraagency) silos exist at many levels in Oklahoma.</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li>Strengthen connections between SAT-ED's initial steering committee and the Children’s State Advisory Workgroup; formalize the SAT-ED-specific responsibilities in the memorandums of understanding (MOUs).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div> 

<h3 class="accordion-header">Financing and Financial Mapping	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul><li>ODMHSAS has collected a significant amount of financial data for fiscal year 2012. </li>
  <li> ODMHSAS has various data-sharing agreements associated with its many Federal grants and recently developed an overarching data-sharing agreement for the SAT-ED initiative and for broader use. ODMHSAS legal staff are reviewing this new data-sharing agreement, soon expected to be ready for implementation. </li>
  <li> ODMHSAS is trying to expand its Recovery Support Specialist (RSS) codes that currently permit reimbursement of RSS services only for youth ages 18 and older. </li>
  <li> ODMHSAS uses some of its Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant and State funds to support adolescent substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. </li>
  <li> Oklahoma’s behavioral health Medicaid program reimburses on a fee-for-service single-payer model. ODMHSAS uses a waterfall payment mechanism to determine the appropriate payer.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li> ODMHSAS should consider reducing the minimum age requirement for RSS to ages 16 and older. </li>
<li> Oklahoma’s SAT-ED initiative still needs financial information from OJA, DHS, and other child-serving agencies. </li>
<li> Oklahoma Medicaid does not reimburse residential treatment for youth with SUDs. </li>
<li> Mental health practitioners may not capture a secondary SUD diagnosis. Providers are discouraged from identifying SUDs if they are not licensed to treat SUDs.  </li>
<li> Oklahoma does not have a Medicaid code for reimbursement of RSS to adolescent SUD clients. Oklahoma’s data set identifies co-occurring treatment, but its providers have no financial incentives to provide this higher cost care.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li> Ensure financial mapping is a high priority in the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (ODMHSAS) policy discussions; ensure the dedication of appropriate staff resources; establish a data workgroup and chairperson with significant cross-systems information technology and data experience. </li>
      <li> Unbundle the ODMHSAS adolescent residential reimbursement rate to require providers to bill Medicaid and other third parties for the clinical service component. Funds could thereby be reallocated for other purposes, such as to disseminate the Global Appraisal for Individual Needs (GAIN) and Assertive Community Reinforcement Approach (ACRA). </li>
      <li> Consider including youth with a primary substance use disorder (SUD) diagnosis in the ODMHSAS health home initiative. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Workforce Development	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>ODMHSAS conducted a 2011 workforce behavioral health study that provides information that may inform a SAT-ED-specific workforce development survey. </li>
  <li> ODMHSAS’ SAT-ED initiative has supported a number of training events for providers and other child-serving staff on the neuroscience of adolescent drug use and training for youth on leadership and peer recovery support. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul><li>  ODMHSAS does not have a SAT-ED workforce development plan.</li>
  <li> The ODMHSAS SAT-ED initiative needs to capture Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) data on training events supported in part or whole by SAT-ED funds. </li>
  <li> OJA providers are increasingly pursuing certification and licenses in SUD treatment, potentially creating duplicative parallel SUD treatment systems.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li>Develop an ODMHSAS  workforce dissemination plan by January 6, 2014, to address the specialty sector and other child-serving agencies.
  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation of Evidence-Based Practices	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> SAT-ED staffs at both provider agencies are GAIN I certified.</li>
  <li> Both SAT-ED provider sites are working toward their full ACRA certification. </li>
  <li> SAT-ED providers have served 50 youth to date and have collected GPRA followup data on 10 youth. </li>
  <li> Both providers reported some benefits from using the GAIN I assessment and the Assertive Community Reinforcement Approach (ACRA) model. </li>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Oklahoma’s sites describe the GAIN I as long and arduous and contributing to client frustration and adverse effects on client engagement. Provider staff currently break the GAIN I implementation into two or three sessions but are reimbursed for only one assessment session. </li>
<li> Both providers discussed continuing care retention challenges because most youth are referred by OJA for a limited 3-month probation period and the youth are not interested in continuing care after their probation ends. </li>
<li> Oklahoma may experience difficulties because of conflicting requirements. Although the ACRA model requires that users have a bachelor’s degree, Oklahoma requires that users have a master’s degree. </li>
<li> Oklahoma does not have enough licensed clinicians in its workforce to deliver ACC recovery support services in the community. SAT-ED providers must use recovery support staff who are not clinicians to deliver the Assertive Continuing Care (ACC).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Encourage both provider agencies to explore family and youth engagement strategies that are compatible with the ACRA/Assertive Continuing Care (ACC) model.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Family and Youth Involvement	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul><li>Oklahoma is developing a parent support organization, Parents Helping Parents, for families of youth with a primary SUD. </li>
  <li> Oklahoma’s adolescent Recovery High School has a specific Alcoholics Anonymous group open to community youth with SUDs.</li>
  <li> Oklahoma’s SAT-ED initiative has a close working relationship with Oklahoma’s Citizen Advocates for Recovery and Treatment Association (OCARTA), a new advocacy contract with a substance abuse treatment provider to run the drop-in center for youth, and attempts have been made to start a youth advisory council. </li>
  <li> The SAT-ED team did a great job of convening a panel of diverse youth and families to share their experiences accessing adolescent SUD treatment.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul><li> Staff training is needed to support youth who are transitioning from inpatient treatment to outpatient community settings. </li>
  <li> Most Oklahoma parents interviewed by the site visit team reported that substance abuse treatment was not available to individuals who lacked insurance. One parent reported she had to sell her home to pay for her child’s treatment. Most parents also reported having to go out of State to obtain adolescent SUD treatment. </li>
  <li> Several parents reported being unable to obtain assistance or support when accessing treatment for their children until they connected with one of Oklahoma’s three chapters of Parents Helping Parents. Oklahoma may want to explore how to use this organization as a mechanisms for obtaining input from parents in its SAT-ED initiative. Oklahoma may also want to promote the development of a Latino chapter of Parents Helping Parents. </li>
  <li> Youth reported that schools were the source of their access to substances and provided the social opportunities that supported their substance abuse. Youth also reported that, although their schools had drug-sniffing dogs and scanning devices to deter drug use, the schools offer few or no drug prevention or early intervention opportunities. This challenge was similarly described by parents who reported that, when their children were identified as using drugs, the schools focused solely on lengthy suspensions and expulsions and did not help them access SUD treatment resources.</li>
  <li> Parents reported that the lack of access to adolescent SUD treatment resulted in their children's eventual involvement in the juvenile justice system, which similarly did not facilitate access to treatment, even when parents specifically requested assistance. </li>
  <li> Families of youth with a primary SUD have the same need for treatment as families with youth who have a primary mental disorder. </li>
  <li> Youth reported few opportunities to participate in prosocial activities, hobbies, and other activities that provide healthful alternatives to substance use. </li>
  <li> Oklahoma’s families affected by SUDs need the opportunities to grow and develop in the same way as families with mental disorders.</li></ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li> Strengthen existing State structures to support families of youth with SUDs before expanding to include parents and youth who are focused on mental health efforts.</li>
      <li> Engage the articulate youth with whom the site visit team met and use them on a panel for different constituency groups (e.g., agency staff, legislators). </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Evaluation	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul><li>ODMHSAS’ SAT-ED evaluation component has a rudimentary site-level evaluation plan that may be informed by the cross-agency data-sharing agreement currently in review.</li>
  <li>The SAT-ED evaluator described a plan at the site level that would include satisfaction measures on the process of entering treatment and treatment quality.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li> ODMHSAS’ SAT-ED initiative has not begun evaluating the required infrastructure measures.  </li>
<li>ODMHSAS’ SAT-ED is in the process of accessing all of the GAIN I data. </li>
<li>ODMHSAS’ SAT-ED providers appear to be entering their own GPRA data, and the GPRA quality control process is not clear.</li>
<li> Oklahoma’s SAT-ED initiative will be adapting its ACC model and may encounter associated challenges. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>  
    <ul>
      <li> Increase the SAT-ED initiative's evaluation focus on the required ED activities and formalize this process in an operational plan. </li>
      <li> Encourage the evaluator to work with evaluators from other SAT-ED States that are implementing the ACRA/ACC model with fidelity to explore the importance of fidelity to achieving intended outcomes. </li>
      <li> Encourage the evaluator to identify and document the changes Oklahoma is making in its ACC model and ensure that these changes are implemented uniformly. </li>
      <li> Erect a firewall to ensure separation of implementation and evaluation. Because the current lead evaluator expressed a preference for implementation, consider redesigning the evaluation team.</li>
    </ul>

</div>
<p>The fiscal year 2012 Cooperative Agreements for the <strong>State Adolescent Treatment Enhancement and Dissemination (SAT-ED)</strong>&nbsp;initiative provides funding to the following 12 States and 1 territory to improve State infrastructure and treatment for adolescents with substance use disorders (SUDs) or co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Illinois</li>
  <li>Indiana</li>
  <li>Iowa</li>
  <li>Kentucky</li>
  <li>Louisiana</li>
  <li>Maine</li>
  <li>Massachusetts</li>
  <li>Montana</li>
  <li>New York</li>
  <li>Oklahoma</li>
  <li>Puerto Rico</li>
  <li>South Carolina</li>
  <li>Washington</li>
</ul>
<p>Through the SAT-ED award, the State or territory collaborates with two local community-based treatment providers to implement an evidence-based practice (EBP), provide services to youth and families, and establish a feedback loop to enable the grantee to identify barriers and test solutions through a real-time services component. Grantees are expected to achieve several outcomes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Address needed changes to policies and procedures.</li>
  <li>Develop financing structures that support the current service delivery environment.</li>
  <li>Develop and implement a statewide workforce development dissemination plan.</li>
  <li>Create a blueprint to increase the use of EBPs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Youth and their families are critical to this effort and must be included in planning, implementation, and dissemination of all activities and knowledge. To meet these expectations, SAT-ED grantees are required to conduct several activities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improve interagency collaboration.</li>
  <li>Conduct financial mapping to inform the development of funding and payment strategies that are practical and feasible in the funding environment.</li>
  <li>Expand the qualified workforce to meet increasing service delivery needs.</li>
  <li>Disseminate EBPs.</li>
  <li>Involve youth and their families at all levels to inform policy, program, and effective practice implementation processes.</li>
</ul>

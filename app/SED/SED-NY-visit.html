    <div id="accordion-container">
<h3 class="accordion-header">Awardee Leadership	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS) is well positioned organizationally at a State cabinet level to enable its New York Serving Adolescents in Need of Treatment (NY-SAINT) SAT-ED initiative to be successful.  </li>
<li>OASAS has an experienced and dedicated management team overseeing New York’s substance use disorder treatment system, including its NY-SAINT initiative.  </li>
<li>The OASAS commissioner has identified adolescents as an important population of focus.</li>
<li>Several statewide initiatives are underway, such as developing health homes and piloting integrated mental health/substance use disorder licensing to develop a service system for youth with co-occurring disorders.  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>OASAS has limited staff resources for the SAT-ED initiative.  </li>
  <li> The State agency organizational structure may create barriers for integration.  </li>
  <li> SAT-ED staff should be more representative of the population.  </li>
  <li> OASAS leadership needs to focus more on NY-SAINT time lines and outcomes.</li>
  <li>OASAS leadership should identify key staff to complete SAT-ED tasks (e.g., a lead person for workforce development, a chair for the financial mapping workgroup).  </li>
  <li>The Medicaid redesign is presenting many challenges and is consuming significant OASAS staff resources.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li> Review and augment the SAT-ED staffing pattern.</li>
      <li>Increase family and youth involvement in the SAT-ED initiative at the State level. </li>
      <li>Increase the use of a public health outreach approach.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
</div> 
     
<h3 class="accordion-header">Interagency Collaboration	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li> New York has a long history of interagency collaboration on children’s issues. OASAS is building on existing infrastructure and relationships.  </li>
<li> Stakeholder buy-in exists for interagency collaboration.  </li>
<li> OASAS is currently using the children’s behavioral health subcommittee of the Council on Children as the child-serving council to assist its NY-SAINT initiative.</li>
<li> There is a standing committee on children’s cross-system issues.  </li>
<li> New York Medicaid redesign is bringing groups together.  </li>
<li> OASAS is piloting integrated licensing for mental health and substance abuse treatment for adolescents.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>OASAS may need to more closely examine the agencies represented on the interagency council to ensure all relevant child-serving agencies are represented, fully engaged in the NY-SAINT initiative, and able to formalize their commitments in memorandums of agreement.  
<li> Interagency council members do not appear knowledgeable and/or engaged in SAT-ED.
<li> Representatives from the Department of Education and Medicaid are needed on the interagency council.  
<li> Decisionmakers and mid-level managers within all child-serving agencies need more communication about SAT-ED, and future interagency council meetings need to focus more specifically on the NY-SAINT initiative and be held at times conducive to attendance by family and youth representatives.  
<li> Interagency council meetings need to be family and youth friendly to become effective.  
<li>A workforce training plan needs to be developed with other State agencies.
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Enhance the interagency council members’ understanding of the use of Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment for substance abuse treatment and recovery services. </li>
      <li>Request that the interagency council members prioritize what they hope to gain from the SAT-ED initiative.</li>
      <li> Improve the interagency council’s involvement with SAT-ED.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div> 

<h3 class="accordion-header">Financing and Financial Mapping	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Information sharing and trust building exists among the collaborating agencies actively engaged in NY-SAINT’s financial mapping process.</li>
  <li> The group was engaged in the financial mapping conversation.  </li>
  <li> OASAS is working with the Center for Mental Health Services grantee, mental health staff, and counties.  </li>
  <li> New York is using Salient software for Medicaid claims data, which allows for flexible data analysis and should be helpful in developing financial maps.  </li>
  <li> Medicaid rates are the same for mental health and substance abuse. </li>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li> Juvenile justice and Medicaid are missing from the financing workgroup.  </li>
<li> New York will create a Medicaid capitated rate, and OASAS needs to determine how SAT-ED can assist with all the tasks, including rate setting, from the Medicaid redesign.  </li>
<li> The cost analysis of substance use disorder treatment models will be a complex task.  </li>
<li> The risk arrangements in the proposed Medicaid redesign are unclear.</li>
<li> OASAS should explore using the Medicaid waivers or State plan amendments to provide substance use disorder treatment and recovery for substance abuse, similar to available mental health services.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li>Crosswalk Medicaid services definitions and Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS) services definitions.</li>
      <li> Consider using financial mapping to help OASAS reallocate resources and prepare for the Medicaid redesign. </li>
      <li> Have the New York Serving Adolescents in Need of Treatment (NY-SAINT) initiative finalize the financial mapping decision rules and start the financial mapping process.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Workforce Development	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> OASAS articulated an acute awareness of its State’s adolescent substance use disorder workforce challenges.  </li>
  <li>OASAS has already developed some training materials on adolescent substance use.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul><li> OASAS has no requirements for an adolescent credential.  </li>
  <li>There is a lack of appreciation of the skills needed by the workforce to address adolescent co-occurring issues.</li>
  <li> There is a need to create and implement a workforce plan to move the workforce from adolescent-specific knowledge exposure to skills and competencies development.  </li>
  <li>The topic areas from other child-serving agencies need to be included in the workforce plan.  </li>
  <li>The learning community within the provider sites is behind schedule. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li>Develop a completed workforce development dissemination plan and send to the Government Project Officer (GPO) by November 1.</li>
      <li>OASAS should consider an adolescent provider-level endorsement or credential. </li>
      <li> New York should operationalize the workforce development dissemination plan statewide as soon as possible.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
    
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation of Evidence-Based Practices	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul><li>There is an awareness and a need for a continuing care approach and recovery supports.</li>
  <li>NY-SAINT’s providers are both trained and certified in the Seven Challenges model and the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN).</li>
  <li>OASAS will conduct a site audit on implementation fidelity.  </li>
  <li>The sites will also receive visits by the evidence-gased practice (EBP) model developers to assess implementation fidelity.  </li>
  <li>There are other adolescent EBP models in the State.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The number of adolescents being served is low relative to the cost.</li>
<li> Providers are experiencing continuity of coverage and deductible and copayment issues with insurance.</li>
<li> Implementation fidelity of the Seven Challenges program needs to be confirmed at both sites because the program length varies by 6 months between the sites, and one site appears to be concurrently implementing multiple evidence-based programs.  </li>
<li>GAIN implementation is taking too long, and exploration of the GAIN motivational interviewing (MI) version may be needed. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li> OASAS should consider adapting a mental health care coordination model for adolescents with substance use and/or co-occurring mental health disorders, as the Franklin County provider site is doing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Need for Technical Assistance Requests</b>  
    <ul>
      <li>Obtain technical assistance on peer or recovery coaching. </li>
      <li> Obtain technical assistance to help conceptualize a comprehensive continuum of treatment and recovery services for adolescents with substance use disorders and a pathway to that care.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Family and Youth Involvement	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul><li>OASAS has a parent consultant under contract who has prior State-level work experience. Her knowledge and experience positions her to be a strong advocate and parent leader for the NY-SAINT initiative.  </li>
  <li> OASAS identified excellent and articulate parent representatives to meet with the site visit team.  </li>
  <li> Youth are willing to take a leadership role in the SAT-ED initiative.  </li>
  <li> Youth demonstrated understanding of addiction.  </li>
  <li> Youth believe drug testing is a good thing and that it reinforces abstinence; however, they indicated some programs end testing too early, potentially leading to relapse.  </li>
  <li> Youth expressed a need for co-occurring substance use disorder and mental health treatment and peer-supported recovery. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> There does not appear to be a sufficient structure to support the parents.  </li>
  <li>OASAS needs to prioritize developing the family voice for planning and technical assistance (e.g., Sue Smith, from Georgia, is responsible for the technical assistance).  </li>
  <li> Parents need information and need to be engaged.  </li>
  <li> A single point of access should be considered with community outreach and engagement.  </li>
  <li> Parents expressed concerns about the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.</li>
  <li> Youth suggested direct care staff be trained in strength-based approaches and be better supervised.</li>
  <li>Youth expressed a need for more prosocial activities with peers.  </li>
  <li> Youth noted the State should not wait until high school to address substance use since most youth started using substances in middle school.  </li>
  <li> Youth described long residential lengths of stay (8–18 months); multiple treatment admissions (4–5 admissions each); and a lack of gender-specific, family-focused, and trauma-informed approaches.  </li>
  <li> Youth expressed fear about transitioning from residential programs to the community and a need for post-residential transition programs that address transitional planning, living skills, recovery support, and transitional services in the community.  </li>
  <li> OASAS should consider using Seven Challenges in residential settings.  </li>
  <li> Youth expressed the need for more family involvement in treatment.</li></ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Explore opportunities for gender-specific and trauma-informed care. </li>
      <li> Develop individualized adolescent treatment plans. </li>
      <li> Develop intensive community-based care and transitional services. </li>
      <li> Review the residential adolescent treatment lengths of stay and number of treatment episodes to identify and address opportunities for improvement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>Need for Technical Assistance Requests</b>  
    <ul>
      <li>Provide assistance in building a structure for the family voice.</li>
      <li> Obtain technical assistance in the area of family involvement. </li>
      <li> Offer scholarships to support an adolescent substance abuse pathway track in the Youth Power University program and scholarships for the involvement of adolescents and families in this training effort.</li>
      <li> Provide John Kelly with technical assistance in community adolescent peer 12-steps groups. </li>
      <li> Explore opportunities for gender-specific and trauma-informed care.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Evaluation	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul><li>OASAS has a well-developed NY-SAINT site-level evaluation plan and detailed protocol guide; Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA)  data indicate NY-SAINT is exceeding the 80 percent followup threshold.  </li>
  <li>The evaluator is collecting data on additional variables at the sites.</li>
  <li>OASAS agreed to be a pilot for infrastructure measures. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>There is no written or operationalized plan for infrastructure evaluation.  </li>
<li> The qualitative research methods for infrastructure need to be strengthened.  </li>
<li> GPRA data for infrastructure need to be tracked.  </li>
<li> There is a need to improve the evaluator’s understanding of infrastructure and qualitative evaluation methods.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>  
    <ul>
      <li>Prepare the evaluation plan by November 1, 2013, and send to the GPO.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Information Requested</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Obtain recommendations on the qualitative research methods to use to assess SAT-ED infrastructure.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>

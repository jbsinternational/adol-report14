<h3 class="accordion-header">Awardee Leadership	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The LA SAT-ED initiative has the full participation of high-level policy leaders.</li>
<li>There appears to be a cohesive team in place.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The program has experienced significant staffing changes over the first 18 months.</li>
<li>Multiple SAT-ED requirements must be addressed concurrently over the next 16 months, and the current staffing pattern does not appear to support this level of effort.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
     <li>Review the level of effort of in-kind staff dedicated to SAT-ED, and consider augmenting through paid staff or contracts.</li>

  <li><b>Need for Technical Assistance Requests</b></li>
</ul>
</div> 
     
<h3 class="accordion-header">Interagency Collaboration	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The LA SAT-ED interagency council has most of its required members and memoranda of understanding.</li>
<li>The council has a subcommittee structure that could be used to support required SAT-ED activities.</li>.
<li>The existing interagency structure has the potential to facilitate SAT-ED sustainability after the award ends.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The council is missing youth and family SUD representation. 
<li>The council meets only four times a year, making it essential for substance use disorder (SUD) content to be infused into the subcommittees.</li>
<li>The current leadership has expertise in mental health advocacy but less in SUDs. </li>
<li>There is no State agency representative in a council leadership role.,/
<li>There is no dedicated committee to develop and implement either the financial map or the SAT-ED workforce dissemination plan.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Add youth and family substance use disorder (SUD) representation to the council.</li>
<li>Add SUD expertise on every subcommittee.</li>
<li>Consider adopting a cochair model to include State agency leadership.</li>
<li>Develop a common shared SUD agenda and move it forward through interagency council activities.</li>
<li>Review the mechanisms the council can use to facilitate policy change across child-serving agencies.
</li>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Financing and Financial Mapping	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li> Louisiana has successfully achieved Medicaid coverage for youth with SUD diagnoses.</li>
<li>The Office of Behavioral Health (OBH) articulated a comprehensive vision of a behavioral health service array for youth regardless of diagnosis.</li>
<li>Medicaid appears to use a proactive approach to fully participating in the development of the service array for youth with behavioral health disorders.</li>
<li>The program achieves the most possible from Federal Medicaid funds by blending funds from multiple child-serving agencies to serve youth with behavioral health disorders.</li>
<li>OBH is proactively thinking about its new managed care procurement and associated enhancements.</li>
<li>OBH is using Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment block grant funding for youth treatment.</li>
<li>OBH is making strong progress in expanding Medicaid-covered services, including development of rates for Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA) A-CRA and Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN).</li>
<li>The program has much financial data to populate the required SAT-ED financial map.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The Medicaid rates appear to be low and do not support all the components of an evidence-based practice (EBP).</li>
<li>Louisiana does not have sufficient funds to address the needs of youth with SUDs and their families.</li>
<li>OBH will need to obtain and disaggregate additional financial data from other sources.</li>
<li>Currently OBH does not have disaggregated data for all child-serving agencies.</li>
<li>OBH does not yet have rates inclusive of actual costs for many services.</li>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Consider the benefits of having a rate study.</li>
<li> Consider establishing Medicaid presumptive eligibility.</li>
<li>Develop a SAT-ED-required financial map in anticipation of the June due date.</li>
<li>Obtain and disaggregate additional financial data from other sources.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Information Requested</b></li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Workforce Development	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
 <li>OBH has a strong Medicaid managed care initiative whose staff are willing to help the provider community adjust to managed care.</li>
<li>The SAT-ED sites have completed all GAIN training certifications, and most staff have completed A-CRA certification.</li>
<li>LA SAT-ED has begun talking with other child-serving agencies such as juvenile justice and child welfare to identify training opportunities and needs.</li>
<li> LA SAT-ED has planned SUD sessions at an upcoming conference. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>LA SAT-ED does not have a workforce development dissemination plan.</li>
<li>LA SAT-ED does not have a structure that supports formal training of child-serving agencies.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
<li>Develop a workforce development dissemination plan. </li>
<li> Begin implementation of basic SUD training while simultaneously developing the comprehensive sequenced training plan.</li>
<li> Work with Louisiana’s regional Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) to identify and use existing training content and opportunities.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
    <li><b>Information Requested</b>    </li>
    
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation of Evidence-Based Practices	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The sites described positive experiences with both the GAIN and A-ACRA Assertive Continuing Care (ACC) EBPs.</li>
<li>The staff described benefits of A-CRA, including that it brings focus, breaks down complex information, teaches real-world skills, and is flexible.</li>
<li>The SAT-ED sites have developed an incentive plan to address youth and family retention challenges.</li>
<li>One SAT-ED provider found a creative solution to client transportation barriers.</li>
<li>The Medicaid benefit of up to 24 outpatient sessions that do not require preauthorization facilitates client access to ACR-A.
</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>SAT-ED providers expressed challenges with the current flow of referrals.</li>
<li>One SAT-ED provider reported having redundant assessments (two lengthy assessments) to meet agency accreditation requirements.</li>
<li>SAT-ED providers expressed several engagement challenges.</li>
<li>SAT-ED providers expressed some concern about SAT-ED staff retention.</li>
<li>The SAT-ED-providers do not have a robust array of recovery and support services.</li>
<li>The SAT-ED providers expressed difficulties getting families to engage in the A-CRA model. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
<li>Explore whether family incentives are included in the current incentive approach; if not, consider implementing them.</li>
<li> Continue to receive technical assistance (TA) on engagement and retention.</li>
<li>Explore opportunities to streamline the assessment process.</li>
<li>Explore opportunities to increase access to recovery services and supports for youth and families.</li>

</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Family and Youth Involvement	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> The LA SAT-ED arranged for interviews with articulate parents and youth who shared their SUD treatment experiences; this approach can greatly inform enhancements to this system.</li>
<li> Both parents and youth interviewed agreed to participate in the program’s interagency council or other related processes.</li>
<li>Both parents and youth groups demonstrated outstanding resilience in spite of the many system barriers they encountered.</li>
<li>Both parent and youth groups offered concrete recommendations to enhance the system.</li>
<li>Families and youth reported favorable assistances from vocational rehabilitation (not facilitated by the treatment agencies).</li>
Once parents and youth were connected to the right services, they were complimentary about the services they received (e.g., Drug Court).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul><li>Parents and youth lack concrete assistance and information to identify and navigate the SUD treatment system. </li>
  <li> Parents and youth lack access to needed continuing care and recovery supports. </li>
  <li> Louisiana lacks formal structures to support parents and youth with SUD challenges and to use their voice and lived experience to inform SUD policy and practice. </li>
  <li> Both parents and youth groups interviewed reported rampant drug use in schools, and even when they specifically asked for SUD referral assistance, school counselors were not equipped to provide assistance.</li>
  <li> Youth reported that teachers were often not aware of their substance use, and when they were, they did not offer any concrete assistance. </li>
  <li> Both parents and youth reported access to print or electronic SUD information was insufficient. </li>
  <li> Parents and youth reported a lack of providers capable in co-occurring disorders resulted in years of missed opportunities for accurate diagnoses. </li>
  <li> Parents and youth reported significant financial barriers to treatment, even when insured. </li>
  <li> There is a need to clarify the “fail-first” policy for accessing youth residential treatment.</li>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Build a State structure to support parents and youth with SUD issues. </li>
      <li> Train schools on how to identify and refer youth and families needing SUD assessment and treatment. </li>
      <li> Enhance the OBH Web site to include user-friendly SUD treatment resource information. </li>
      <li> Consider including vocational rehabilitation and the Department of Labor on the interagency council and to institutionalize these resources throughout treatment programs. </li>
      <li> Strengthen the capacity of the OBH behavioral health treatment system to ensure all providers are at least capable with co-occurring disorders. </li>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Evaluation	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>

<li> The evaluators developed a comprehensive site-level evaluation plan.</li>
<li> The evaluators are looking at disparities. </li>
<li> The evaluation team meets regularly with the SAT-ED project director and SAT-ED sites.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li> The SAT-ED evaluation team does not have a State-level infrastructure evaluation plan. </li>
<li> There is a need to establish baseline data for the infrastructure measures. </li>
<li> The evaluation design is complex, and some key findings are not clear. </li>
</ul>

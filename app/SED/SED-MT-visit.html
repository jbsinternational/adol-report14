    <div id="accordion-container">
<h3 class="accordion-header">Awardee Leadership	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Managers from Montana’s Children’s Mental Health Bureau (CMHB) and Addictive and Mental Disorders Division (AMDD) and CMHB’s division administrator participated in the site visit meetings and are engaged in the SAT-ED project.  </li>
<li> The CMHB bureau chief has a good understanding of both adolescent substance and mental health issues. </li>
<li> Montana’s SAT-ED team is interested in and concerned about the future of adolescent substance abuse services and co-occurring treatment in Montana.   </li>
<li> AMDD is collaborating with CMHB on a continuum of care and adolescent recovery-oriented system of care pilot with one of the SAT-ED selected provider sites.  </li>
<li>Montana’s SAT-ED team requests and utilizes implementation technical assistance.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Montana does not currently have a youth substance abuse treatment coordinator with policy and clinical expertise in adolescent substance use disorders (SUDs) (as stated on page 9 of the request for applications). </li>
  <li> Responsibility for Montana’s children’s mental health services and youth chemical dependency services lies in two different divisions of the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services. </li>
  <li> There appears to be significant and widespread stigma in Montana associated with SUDs that is not present for mental health disorders. </li>
  <li> There are apparent inequities in allocating the Medicaid State match to address access to adolescent SUD treatment compared to adolescent mental health treatment. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li>Identify a youth substance abuse coordinator to lead the SAT-ED management team.  </li>
      <li>Augment the current SAT-ED project team with someone who has policy and clinical expertise in adolescent substance use disorders (SUDs).   </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Need for Technical Assistance Requests</b>
    <ul>
      <li> Create a comprehensive statewide public education campaign to change attitudes of funders, including legislators, about addiction as a developmental disorder that begins in adolescence.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
</div> 
     
<h3 class="accordion-header">Interagency Collaboration	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Montana’s interagency council is a subcommittee of the statutorily required System of Care committee. The site visit team observed strong leadership in the facilitation of Montana’s interagency council that set the tone for collaboration and open discussion.  </li>
<li>The interagency council voiced its commitment to SAT-ED requirements including financial mapping and workforce development.</li>
<li>The interagency council members articulated an understanding of statewide infrastructure issues. </li>
<li>The interagency council communicated its concerns about the limitations of the SAT-ED Integrated Co-occurring Treatment (ICT) model, particularly its primary focus on small caseloads of youth with severe emotional disturbance.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li> The council is committed to identifying an additional evidence-based practice (EBP) model that could be used for the majority of the adolescent substance abuse population and appreciates the importance of a relational approach.  
<li> The SAT-ED council includes all agency members required by the SAT-ED award except a public health leader and youth member. There is also a need for greater participation of parents on the council.</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a public health leader and youth member to the interagency council.  Formalize a memorandum of agreement between the Children’s Mental Health Bureau (CMHB) and the Addictive and Mental Disorders Division (AMDD).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Need for Technical Assistance Requests</b></li>
</ul>
</div> 

<h3 class="accordion-header">Financing and Financial Mapping	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The 1915(i) waiver for children’s mental health is very strong and comprehensive for community services.  </li>
<li> Members from key State agencies with various funding are well represented.</li>
<li> The billing rates for both substance abuse and mental health claims are determined using a resource-based relative value scale.   </li>
<li> The State agencies have a comprehensive and outstanding team that is engaged and well informed. Most of the participants understand the value in financial mapping and appreciate its potential application for affecting policy (e.g., preparing a report for the legislature).    </li>
<li> The members asked perceptive questions and proposed adding the financial mapping process to their broader interagency agenda. </li>
<li> The participants have access to most of the data needed to conduct financial mapping.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The workgroup needs to identify a chairperson with financial expertise and an organizational structure and plan to complete the financial mapping task. </li>
<li>AMDD does not spend down all the adolescent substance abuse treatment funds budgeted.  </li>
<li> Juvenile justice does not check on the Medicaid eligibility of youth.  </li>
<li> Mining CBHB’s Medicaid claims data for co-occurring diagnoses is a challenge.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Look into the upcoming changes to Medicaid, including eligibility. </li>
      <li>Look at the State matching formulas. The State legislature has appropriated matching funds for children’s mental health but not for adolescent substance abuse treatment.</li>
      <li>Arrange for technical assistance (TA) for a financial mapping workgroup.  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Information Requested</b></li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Workforce Development	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The workforce advisory committee is well represented and involves the University of Montana.   </li>
  <li>Montana has started topical and substantial trainings with community providers and other child-serving State agencies.  </li>
  <li> Montana is conducting a methodical and informative survey of its current workforce.   </li>
  <li>The student loan repayment program has helped some rural and poor counties recruit and deploy a workforce to underserved communities.   </li>
  <li>There is a growing workforce with dual substance abuse and mental health practitioner licenses, especially among younger professionals.</li>
  <li>The two selected provider site agencies are working together and developing a learning laboratory on the Global Appraisal for Individual Needs (GAIN) and ICT model implementation.  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>There is no State credentialing/licensing to work with adolescents in substance abuse and/or mental health. The State should explore an adolescent endorsement and/or certification.    </li>
  <li> There is no system and/or guidance to the entering workforce on the pathways to becoming a substance abuse counselor in Montana.   </li>
  <li> State reciprocity for substance abuse and/or mental health licensing or certification is difficult.  </li>
  <li> There is a need for more cross-training in professional ethics and substance abuse confidentiality (CFR 42).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li>CMHB requested TA from peer States and/or Addiction Technology Transfer Centers on their online learning programs. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
    <li><b>Information Requested</b>    </li>
    
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation of Evidence-Based Practices	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The providers demonstrated strong knowledge on adolescent substance abuse and mental health treatment experience.  • The providers have a strong school and community focus.   </li>
<li> The provider staff have been trained in GAIN and ICT and have enrolled clients.</li>
<li> The providers are “going to where the kids are” to engage youth.</li>
<li>The providers are tracking third-party payments for the ICT model.</li>
<li> There is an openness to exploring an additional EBP for the majority of youth with primary SUD.</li>
<li> The group is solution focused on how to implement an additional EBP.</li>
<li>Montana’s juvenile justice system engages parents and youth in substance abuse treatment even if they have not been arrested or charged.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The providers and interagency council differ significantly in their perception of the ICT model's strengths and challenges.</li>
<li>The provider sites report a need for adolescent recovery supports.</li>
<li> The clinician and case manager cannot be the same person, given the existing billing system by CMHB.   </li>
<li> Disseminating the GAIN and ICT beyond the two selected sites poses several challenges.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li>Do additional work to identify Medicaid eligibility options for youth who do not meet criteria for serious emotional disturbance but meet SUD criteria.</li>
      <li>Follow up with the providers on Integrated Co-occurring Treatment (ICT) billing issues.  </li>
      <li>Have the SAT-ED team and providers discuss with the ICT model developers how to ensure and maintain model fidelity.  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Need for Technical Assistance Requests</b>  
    <ul>
      <li>Obtain continued TA for a new evidence-based practice.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Family and Youth Involvement	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>CMHB has a family member on staff for children’s mental health and has made this person available to Montana’s SAT-ED initiative.   </li>
  <li> The interviewed youth described an increasing focus among children’s behavioral health staff on relationship building rather than compliance. </li>
  <li> Montana’s child-serving State agencies are thinking about how to include parents and youth in the SAT-ED process.   </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> There is no advocacy for parents or youth with primary SUDs.</li>
  <li> The parents described a lack of in-home services for youth with SUDs or co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders.  </li>
  <li>Middle-income families reported an inability to access the publicly funded system.</li>
  <li>There is a need to develop a leadership group to include and represent youth who have received adolescent substance abuse treatment in Montana. </li>
  <li> The parents expressed a need for substance abuse information, outreach, engagement, and peer supports. </li>
  <li> Despite the significant need for substance abuse treatment expertise, a large segment of Montana’s mental health staff does not have the credentials to treat substance issues. </li>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>

      <li>Identify ways to address the needs of middle-income families that have youth with SUD who are currently having difficulty accessing services.  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <div id="accordion-container">
<h3 class="accordion-header">Awardee Leadership	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li> Indiana has a shared, articulated vision for treating the whole person, to include addressing the integration of substance use and mental health disorders. </li>
<li> There is demonstrated, committed support among Indiana State government and local community partner organizations to meet the SAT-ED award requirements. </li>
<li> High-level support by the Division of Mental Health and Addiction (DMHA) is visible, and officials are engaged and knowledgeable. </li>
<li> The SAT-ED principal investigator and the SAT-ED project director practice and facilitate effective and proactive communication among all State and Federal partners, treatment providers, families, youth, and other stakeholders involved in this project. </li>
<li> Effective, responsive, and proactive communication is occurring between DMHA leadership and the local treatment provider sites, EmberWood Center and Gallahue Mental Health Services. </li>
<li> The SAT-ED principal investigator and the SAT-ED project director began a SAT-ED workgroup when they were hired. This group includes the treatment provider site administrators and treatment staff. </li>
<li> Local treatment site leadership and treatment staff demonstrate a willingness and openness in providing strategic feedback to meet the SAT-ED award requirements. </li>
<li> The two treatment providers represent two types of organizational structures. EmberWood Center is a small, locally managed treatment agency. Gallahue Mental Health Services is part of a large hospital-based organization. </li>
<li> The contracting staff are flexible and informed. </li>
<li> SAT-ED staff have made changes in contracts in a quick and responsive manner. </li>
<li> There is State contract language to build on as SAT-ED staff develop financing packages. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Reorganization can create challenges in business and reporting lines, potentially  disrupting the ongoing work and support of SAT-ED leadership. </li>
<li>This award is both building the State infrastructure and emphasizing provision of evidence-based practices (EBPs). Neither focus existed before. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
     <li>SAT-ED leadership should remain consistent during the reorganization.</li>
    <li>Kevin Moore’s and Andrea Hern’s support will be critical to the continued success in meeting the award goals.</li>
    <li> As Indiana develops its State infrastructure for services based on the needs of youth and adults, the Division of Mental Health and Addiction (DMHA) is encouraged to attend to the new organizational structure and the transition of services for youth moving to adulthood.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div> 
     
<h3 class="accordion-header">Interagency Collaboration	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The State Treatment Advisory Council for Youth (STACY) has some components of an engaged and active advisory board for adolescent substance use and co-occurring mental health disorder treatment. </li>
<li>The SAT-ED workgroup has all the components of a strong learning collaborative. </li>
<li>SAT-ED and STACY demonstrate active and vibrant leadership in expanding evidence-based treatment services for youth in Indiana.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>There is no interagency council at this time. </li>
<li>Recruitment of family and youth representatives for STACY and the new interagency council should continue. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li>With the assistance of Kevin Moore and Andrea Hern, recruit and develop (or coordinate with an already existing high-level Indiana interagency) a council composed of representatives from all adolescent-serving agencies, including Medicaid and youth and family members.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div> 

<h3 class="accordion-header">Financing and Financial Mapping	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Indiana has a solid foundation for creating funding strategies to address the needs of youth with substance use disorders. </li>
<li>There is consistent recognition that funding has not been available to meet the needs of youth with substance use disorders; however, the current environment at the State level supports work on the financing issues. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Medicaid does not fund services for youth with primary substance use disorder diagnoses, although there are now three billing codes for treating substance use disorders as secondary diagnoses. </li>
<li>There is no pathway to substance use disorder treatment for youth except through juvenile justice involvement. </li>
<li>Family-based treatment engagement can be limited by the Federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ (CMS) rule of providing one treatment unit of service per client per day. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Medicaid’s 1915i State plan amendment should be expanded to include services for youth with a primary substance use diagnosis.</li>
<li>Engage Medicaid and Juvenile Justice funders to join the interagency council.</li>
<li>Focus on completing the first fiscal mapping document and include Medicaid and Justice funds.</li>
<li>Bring the funding issues identified by the STACY group to the interagency group for resolution.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Information Requested</b></li>
  <ul>
  <li>Indiana is interested in examples of how other States expanded Medicaid to include services for youth with a primary substance use diagnosis. </li>
  </ul>
  
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Workforce Development	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>There is visible support and interest from the Indiana University system partners. </li>
<li>The largest field placement enrollment for the Indiana University School of Social Work is in mental health and addiction, and there is a class on addiction. </li>
<li>Indiana State standards include continuing education requirements for licensed and certified professionals. </li>
<li>The State now has licensure for the practice of substance use disorder treatment. </li>
<li>SAT-ED staff have identified training topics and themes for the current workforce.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>There are no valid and reliable data on the size and demographics of the current adolescent substance use disorder treatment and recovery workforce. </li>
<li>There is no adolescent-specific endorsement of credential requirements. </li>
<li>There is a need to work on cross-training with mental health clinicians, especially in the area of diagnosis and treatment of co-occurring disorders. </li>
<li>Substance use disorder treatment providers report challenges in recruiting and hiring to match the need for providing treatment services. </li>
<li>There is a need to cross-train staff across child-serving agencies. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
<li>Develop a workforce training plan that includes the current adolescent substance use disorder treatment workforce and other adolescent-serving agencies. Consider working with the programs in the higher education institutes as an allowable activity. Consider a demographic survey of the current workforce.</li>
<li>Develop a comprehensive workforce development dissemination plan that identifies topics, methods, presenters, and time lines, and identify learning modalities appropriate for the workforce development dissemination plan.</li>
<li>At the State level, meet with other child-serving departments and divisions and develop a cross-agency training plan.</li>
<li>Continue to work with the University of Indiana to expand training on the Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA) and Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN) model.</li>
<li>Review the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors’ adolescent specialty endorsement.</li>
<li>Receive a copy of the National Association of State Alcohol/Drug Abuse Directors’ treatment guidelines when they are available in 2014 for further guidance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation of Evidence-Based Practices	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Managers at the treatment provider sites and the clinicians were engaged in implementing the Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA) despite many changes that have occurred in contracting, the evidence-based practice (EBP), the reporting requirements, and population definition.</li> 
<li>The clinicians appreciated the structure of the A-CRA model: It is youth- and family-friendly. </li>
<li>Youth receiving A-CRA like the one-to-one time incorporated into the model. </li>
<li>The clinicians are actively using the Spanish language materials. </li>
<li>Although formal outreach and marketing have not begun, EmberWood Center received a request for A-CRA services from a parent in the community who had heard about it from another parent and called looking for “the service that includes parents.” </li>
<li>EmberWood Center is enthusiastic about implementing its intensive outpatient level of care using the A-CRA model. </li>
<li>The youth consultant is bringing the youth voice to SAT-ED program development. </li>
<li>EmberWood Center and Gallahue Mental Health Services administration and clinicians are active members in the SAT-ED learning community. They demonstrated trust, respect, and comfort in open collaboration discussions. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>One site needs to complete the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN) contracting process with Chestnut Health Services. </li>
<li>There is a need to address concerns about the time to administer the GAIN (including Government Performance and Results Act data) and the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths Assessment and the effects on engaging youth in treatment. </li>
<li>There is a need to develop contracts that use funds to support the treatment provider in the use of A-CRA with award funding as a last resort. </li>
<li>Site-level managers and clinicians have many questions regarding the financing and billing for assessment and treatment services. </li>
<li>A recruitment and outreach plan is needed at the site level. </li>
<li>The treatment providers have struggled to maintain enthusiasm for, commitment to, and flexibility in this project because of frequent changes. </li>
<li>Continuing care approaches need to be expanded, including recovery community supports.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li>SAT-ED and provider site staff should address and resolve issues through conversations with assessment developers and consideration of other GAIN versions. </li>
<li>SAT-ED and provider staff should review and consider implementation of the EBP Assertive Continuing Care.</li>
<li>SAT-ED and provider site staff should develop guidelines and employ procedures for the use of the SAT-ED funds for treatment and recovery services that are not covered.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Family and Youth Involvement	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li> The Indiana SAT-ED initiative has articulate and well-informed parents. </li>
<li> These parents were able to take their continuing experiences and apply their lessons learned to the State of Indiana. </li>
<li> The parents demonstrated continued dedication and tenacity. </li>
<li> The group of young people was candid, forthcoming, and articulate when providing comments. </li>
<li> Individuals were clear and descriptive in communicating the strengths and challenges of the treatment system for youth with substance use disorders. </li>
<li> They described themes of treatment provision that were most helpful to them: 
1. Work to instill in the youth hope that they can achieve their goals in the future.
<ol> 
   <li>Help youth to develop competency in their life skills.</li> 
   <li> Offer many prosocial activities. </li>
   <li> Provide gender-specific treatment. </li>
   <li> Teach youth to be empowered. </li>
   <li> Provide help from staff for continuing care and recovery. </li>
   <li> One-on-one time with the clinician is important. </li>
   <li> Seeds of Hope and Sober Living homes are options to explore for youth. </li>
   <li> There is a need for age-appropriate examples of how to live in recovery. </li>
   <li> Youth could achieve recovery in their home community if the community has the right resources. </li>
   <li> Treat trauma. </li>
   <li> Treat mental health issues in youth with substance use disorders. </li>
   <li> Be careful about diagnosing and prescribing medication for co-occurring mental health issues.</li>

   <li> Provide age-appropriate opportunities for youth with substance use disorders to have fun. </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The parents shared the challenges they endured in seeking initial and continuing treatment and recovery services. They could articulate solutions, but they do not currently have the structure or resources to move their ideas into reality. </li>
<li>Based on parent input, there is a need for the schools to develop recovery awareness and recovery support services. </li>
<li>There is no resource that parents of youth with substance use disorders in Indiana can access for education, information, referral, recovery, or parent-to-parent support. </li>
<li>It is important to educate parents on adolescent substance use and adolescent brain development.</li>
<li>Youth need to have fun and engage in prosocial activities. </li>
<li>Inspire youth to be clean and to want to be clean. </li>
<li>Use of drug testing is inconsistent. </li>
<li>Teachers are not identifying substance use disorders in schools. The exceptions are the teachers at the recovery school. </li>
<li>Listen to youth. </li>
<li>Recognize and treat trauma and mental health conditions.</li>
<li>Be careful when diagnosing and prescribing medication for co-occurring mental health issues. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li> Invite this group of parents to meet and develop an Indiana parent support group, information, and engagement work plan. Provide the administrative support for this effort.</li>
<li> Have Indiana fully fund the implementation of the parent-developed workplan.</li>
<li> Ask the parents for ideas on how they would like to be included to review and comment on policy and funding solutions and challenges.</li>
<li> Create an opportunity for a request for applications (RFA) to leverage parent resources in a structured, formal manner with support and funding.</li>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Evaluation	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>There is an evaluation plan. </li>
<li>The evaluation activities have focused on working with treatment providers to develop site-level measurement systems. </li>
<li>The evaluator has been responsive to the treatment providers’ concerns and developed tools to provide data to address their concerns. Examples include a time study and an automated form that helps the treatment providers schedule their reporting requirements to ensure adequate data reporting.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>There does not appear to be a statewide infrastructure evaluation plan
  An infrastructure evaluation plan must be developed and implemented. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop and implement an evaluation plan for all infrastructure requirements.</li>

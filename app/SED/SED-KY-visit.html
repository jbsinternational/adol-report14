<h3 class="accordion-header">Awardee Leadership	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The program has strong support from State government, including the Cabinet for Health and Family Services secretary.</li>
<li> Substance abuse is a primary area of focus for the First Lady of Kentucky.</li>
<li> The project coordinator provides strong leadership and is supported by staff with historical and institutional knowledge of the work completed in Kentucky under the State Adolescent Substance Abuse Treatment Coordination (SAC) and System of Care grants.</li>
<li> Team leadership clearly communicates three primary goals for Kentucky Substance Abuse Treatment Enhancement and Dissemination (KAT-ED):
<ul>
<li>Improve access to dual diagnosis treatment-capable providers for youth and their families.</li>
<li>Conduct a comprehensive, statewide financial map.</li>
<li>Expand a workforce proficient in evidence-based practices (EBPs).
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li> The Department for Behavioral Health, Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities (DBHDID) is supported by a strong interagency team—the State Interagency Council for Services to Children with Emotional Disabilities (SIAC). 
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The project coordinator needs assistance leading and managing the project over the next 2 years.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
     <li>Explore additional support options to assist the project coordinator in meeting the demands of the changing adolescent treatment environment in Kentucky.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div> 
     
<h3 class="accordion-header">Interagency Collaboration	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li> The Governor’s cabinet and partners meet regularly to discuss current and future services in Kentucky. The State is implementing a “children’s redesign.”</li>
<li>KAT-ED is supported by an established SIAC.</li>
<li>The State of Kentucky has successfully implemented several initiatives aimed at improving services for children including KAT-ED, System of Care grant, and IMPACT/IMPACT Plus.</li></ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>DBHDID is one of several agencies providing services for children. Tracking services and the funding for those services is a large, unmet management task.</li>
<li>Communication across agencies needs to be clearly documented and disseminated to ensure a successful “children’s redesign.</li>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Consider documenting all program activities through an ongoing learning collaborative.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div> 

<h3 class="accordion-header">Financing and Financial Mapping	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
 <li> Medicaid funding for substance abuse treatment services within the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) program was clarified on July 3, 2013. Previously, Kentucky providers were not billing Medicaid for substance abuse services.</li>
 <li>Kentucky entered into a consultant agreement with Mary Armstrong, University of South Florida, to complete the financial mapping activity. Ms. Armstrong is working closely with Robin Rhea, a financial analyst with the Office of the Secretary for Health and Family Services. Decision rules and the Medicaid analysis have been completed. The goal is to complete the initial phase of financial mapping by October 1, 2013.</li>
 <li>Financial mapping includes mental health and co-occurring services and breaks out age categories: under 6, 6–9, 10–17, and 18–20.</li>
 <li>As of January 1, 2014, several funding sources will be available to provide services to children: Medicaid (EPSDT), Medicaid expansion (managed care organizations), private insurance (private payers), and IMPACT/IMPACT Plus.</li>
 <li>SIAC support enhances financial mapping activities by providing interagency information.</li>
 <li>The juvenile justice task force provides support for understanding juvenile justice services and financing to better integrate care.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Kentucky did not bill Medicaid for substance abuse services prior to July 3, 2013; thus, available financial data for substance abuse treatment are limited. </li>
<li>Initial findings from financial mapping activities indicate a significant amount of funding for psychotropic medication and other high-end services (e.g., residential treatment). </li>
<li>The financial mapping baseline data are from FY2011, and service delivery may already have changed.</li>
<li>Kentucky does not have established Medicaid billing rates for substance abuse services. </li>
<li>Community mental health centers (CMHCs) are not consistently billing for screening and assessment.

</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li> Develop a plan for working with Medicaid managed care organizations in preparation for eligibility expansion.</li>
<li> Continue financial mapping beyond Medicaid spending through continued conversations with child welfare, justice, education, vocational rehabilitation, workforce investment, and the alternative school system.</li>
<li> Create a diagram showing varying levels of care provided based on type of coverage and determine how the Department for Behavioral Health, Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities (DBHDID) will meet the gaps in service coverage.</li>
<li> Address psychotropic spending through an SIAC task group.</li>
<li> Develop a plan and educational training for billing for screening and assessment. 
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Workforce Development	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
 A comprehensive workforce study, completed by Deloitte, provides DBHDID with data and recommendations.
<li> The coprincipal investigator completed an EPSDT survey that will provide data for the workforce plan.</li>
<li> Staff at each program site have initiated training in Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA) and Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN). Each site will have local A-CRA and GAIN trainers.</li>
<li> Kentucky has an umbrella GAIN licensing agreement that can be used to promote training across the State.</li>
<li> DBHDID plans to have Chestnut Health Systems train commissioners, State directors, and other State agency leaders in September/October 2013 on assessment and use of the GAIN.</li>
<li> Family and youth leadership academies are in progress.</li>
<li> Kentucky has introduced House Bill 218 to address requirements of an alcohol and drug peer support specialist. The bill would tier provider requirements and expand the eligible workforce.</li>
<li> Youth Empowerment Program (YEP) is working to develop regulations that would create an implementation blueprint for youth peer support services. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li> Kentucky has started compiling resources for a workforce development plan, but the team has not yet documented an overall plan.</li>
<li> A learning collaborative is under development. As the learning collaborative is established, dissemination of EBPs needs to be connected to the larger workforce development plan.</li>
<li> The learning collaborative is dependent on working with Chestnut Health Systems for ongoing training and creating the workforce development plan.</li>
<li> Substance abuse endorsement developed under the SAC grant is not fully supported and does not have a lead administrator. </li>
<li> Medicaid expansion effective January 1, 2014, under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will result in an increase in services for persons eligible. The workforce is not currently available to meet this increased capacity. </li>
<li> Medicaid managed care organizations are still developing criteria and moving toward full implementation, thus workforce requirements for billing are uncertain.</li>
<li> The existing demographics of the workforce do not mirror the population in need.</li>
<li> There is currently no targeted outreach to the immigrant population.</li>
<li> KAT-ED is mandated to distribute Federal funding—30 percent for State activities and 70 percent to provider sites. Workforce development and EBPs are expected to be disseminated across the State; however, the current funding mandate does not support statewide dissemination. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
<li> Complete a comprehensive workforce development plan.</li>
<li>Work with children’s services to identify additional workforce.</li>
<li>Operationalize an adolescent provider endorsement program.</li>
<li>Convene a meeting of providers to address increased capacity through partnerships, referral systems, and subcontracting.</li>
<li>Explore Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA) licensing agreements.</li>
<li>Meet with Medicaid managed care organizations to determine and contribute to requirements for service and billing.</li>
<li>Develop an implementation plan for providing services to immigrant and other racially and ethnically diverse populations.</li>
<li>Develop a plan to establish a workforce that is Medicaid billable (e.g., Mental Health Association qualification).</li>
<li>Create a workforce map.</li>
<li>Ensure the workforce development plan is tied to the learning collaborative.</li>
<li>Explore e-learning and other technology-supported tools to supplement training.</li>
<li>Explore a funding split that will promote statewide dissemination of workforce training and evidence-based practices (EBPs).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Need for Technical Assistance Requests</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Consider technical assistance to develop an implementation plan for providing services to immigrant and other racially and ethnically diverse populations.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  
    <li><b>Information Requested</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Request information to explore e-learning and other technology-supported tools to supplement training.</li>
<li> Request information to explore a funding split that will promote statewide dissemination of workforce training and EBPs.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation of Evidence-Based Practices	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>KAT-ED built implementation science into the provider site request for applications.</li>
<li>DBHDID is working with Campbell County and Whitley County staff to develop individual site workplans addressing EBPs, budget, data collection, and family and youth involvement.</li>
<li>Campbell and Whitley Counties are using A-CRA and GAIN for screening and assessment.</li>
<li>Dual Diagnosis Capability in Youth Treatment (DDCYTN) is being implemented to enhance organization- and site-level assessment and process improvement.</li>
<li>At the State level, a review of children’s behavioral health was completed and 12 recommendations were made. The recommendations are being discussed and integrated into KAT-ED planning.</li>
<li>Providers have placed liaisons in courtrooms and established relationships with judges and the court system to promote assessment and referral.</li>
<li> A-CRA provides a tool to standardize the assessment approach and promotes interaction and communication between kids and parents. A provider staff member commented, “It’s nice to have a tool that you believe in.</li>
<li>Strong support from the judiciary and individual judges promotes integration of services.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li> CMHCs are the only approved substance abuse treatment providers for low-income families.
<li>Supervision at sites is constrained to ensure fidelity to EBPs. This is being addressed and should improve as the KAT-ED project evolves.
<li>DBHDID does not have the infrastructure in place to ensure fidelity to EBPs. Contracts with organizations contain checkboxes asking if an EBP is used.
<li>GAIN takes 2–2 1/2 hours to complete. Staff cannot complete more than two GAIN assessments each day: therefore, it is a challenge for trained clinicians to keep up with the assessments.  </li>
<li>Kentucky does not have an umbrella A-CRA license limiting implementation statewide.</li>
<li>The original proposal required children served through KAT-ED to enter through the Administrative Office of the Court, which encouraged entry into the justice system. A request has been submitted to the Government Project Officer to modify this requirement.</li>
<li>DBHDID recognizes the need to review and revise its contracts to include the quality implementation of EBPs. The learning collaborative can be used to address expectations of practice and outcomes.</li>
<li>Transportation continues to be a barrier to receiving services.</li>
<li>DBHDID’s mission is unclear regarding the scope of the agency’s responsibility for children with substance use disorders versus all children in Kentucky. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
<li>Explore expanding the provider network and revising the current statute for outpatient services delivered only through community mental health services.</li>
<li>Build supervisory requirements into the workforce development plan.</li>
<li>Explore licensing options for A-CRA.</li>
<li>Utilize the learning collaborative to address expectations of practice and outcomes for inclusion in future contracts.</li>
<li>Finalize the approval of an open referral source from any agency to eliminate the need for a child to enter through the juvenile justice system.</li>
<li>Consider asking the State Interagency Council for Services to Children with Emotional Disabilities (SIAC) to clarify the charge of DBHDID and the population it is responsible for serving.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Family and Youth Involvement	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>DBHDID has partnered with Kentucky (KY) Partnership, an established family and youth advocacy organization.
 <li>KY Partnership is conducting focus groups with parents in provider communities to assess family needs.
 <li>Family and youth are represented on the SIAC.</li>
 <li>Family and youth activities are built into provider services including coping skills BINGO, social events, and peer and family support groups.</li>
 <li>Youth have created YEP to promote youth peer support. YEP is supporting implementation of a regulation making youth peer support a billable service.</li>
 <li>A youth empowerment summit is held annually. Campbell and Whitley Counties are engaged in this event.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> Minimal services or supports are available for transitional youth.</li>
<li> Support for families and youth are often linked to entry into the criminal or juvenile justice system.</li>
<li> Currently youth enter into KY Partnership through word of mouth.</li>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
<li>Integrate social media into service delivery.</li>
<li>Consider connecting with national youth programs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>Need for Technical Assistance Requests</b>
  <ul>
  <li>
Consider a marketing plan targeted toward transitional youth to promote connection with available services. 
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Evaluation	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The evaluator has extensive experience with GPRA reporting and adolescent treatment outcomes and reporting processes.</li>
<li>Two provider sites are active and reporting GPRA data.</li>
<li>Data analysis is completed quickly and used to inform the grants management team.</li>
<li>DBHDID has a plan for collecting followup data.
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li> DBHDID needs a plan to evaluate implementation of the workforce development plan.</li>
<li>There are no clear measures for evaluating family and youth involvement.</li>
<li>Three-month followup data may show an increase in use because youth have built relationships with counselors and are more honest about use.</li>
<li>Not all children being screened and assessed are captured. Only children receiving the A-CRA are counted and reported to GPRA.</li>
<li> Provider sites are required to complete data collection for both the Adolescent Kentucky Treatment Outcome Study (KTOS) and KAT-ED, requiring duplication of data collection.</li>
<li> The evaluation plan does not specify how health disparities or dosage information will be collected and evaluated.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li> Ensure that all children screened are counted as receiving services through the Kentucky Substance Abuse Treatment Enhancement and Dissemination (KAT-ED) program.
</li>
<li>Explore the use of Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN) across services to eliminate duplication introduced by capturing data through the Adolescent Kentucky Treatment Outcome Study (KTOS) and GAIN.</li>
<li> Consider incorporating measurements of family and youth involvement, health disparities, and dosage into the final evaluation plan.
</li>
    </ul>

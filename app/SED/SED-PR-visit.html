    <div id="accordion-container">
<h3 class="accordion-header">Awardee Leadership	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li> Although there has been turnover at top levels of the Mental Health and Anti-Addiction Services Administration (MHAASA), leadership has strongly supported the SAT-ED initiative.</li>
<li>  The initiative’s leadership has successfully navigated the challenges associated with turnover within the agency, including the continuity of the project’s immediate supervisors. </li>
<li>The leadership team has a diverse skill set, including significant experience in areas relevant to award goals and objectives. </li>
<li> The initiative has a competent and committed project director. </li>
<li> MHAASA takes a public health approach toward addressing the territory’s co-occurring mental health and substance abuse issues. </li>
<li> Key staff are competent and well informed about the initiative and its primary objectives.</li>
<li> The agency’s current goals and objectives appear congruent with the SAT-ED initiative.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>MHAASA has experienced turnover in key positions of the administration.</li>
  <li>MHAASA currently has an interim chief administrator, potentially making it difficult to establish the long-term working relationships with other State-level agency leadership necessary to accomplish the infrastructure initiatives. </li>
  <li> Recent changes in top-level leadership create challenges in maintaining current SAT-ED momentum.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Have the awardee agency’s chief administrator focus on maintaining the initiative's current staffing and momentum.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
</div> 
     
<h3 class="accordion-header">Interagency Collaboration	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
<li> The SAT-ED leadership team rapidly developed a collaborative council with adequate representation and authority. </li>
<li> The interagency advisory council maintains an equitable voice across all participating agencies. </li>
<li> The territory’s Department of Labor is committed to supporting the initiative’s goals by working to develop opportunities to serve as long-term recovery support for youth recovering from substance use disorders (SUDs) and co-occurring mental health disorders. </li>
<li> The interagency advisory council was developed directly as a result of the SAT-ED initiative; this will help ensure the initiative’s goals and objectives remain the group's primary focus. </li>
<li> The membership of the interagency advisory council ensures that the multiple statewide planning councils are connected and can conduct effective advocacy and leverage authority. </li>
<li> The council’s membership is connected to the Governor’s planning council. </li>
<li> The council has developed collaborative agreements between partner agencies to delineate, prioritize, and streamline the referral and access to services of youth in recovery. </li>
<li> There is a strong relationship between substance abuse and mental health services and infrastructure. </li>
<li> The council has identified health disparities associated with substance abuse and co-occurring mental health treatment as an area needing to be addressed. The council’s focus on this area should be phased in as work on this initiative proceeds.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The interagency advisory council’s membership does not include representatives from the territory’s departments of Education or Health, or the Medicaid office.
<li>To further encourage integration and collaboration, interagency advisory council members could benefit from developing a more comprehensive understanding of each participating agency’s services and mandates.
<li> The SAT-ED team is having difficulty maintaining connections with other territory-level planning and advocacy groups.</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li> Facilitate a discussion with the membership of the interagency advisory council to enable participating agencies to adequately represent the mission, goals, and mandates of each individual agency to further synergistic collaboration. </li>
      <li> Secure representatives from the territory’s departments of Education, Health, and the Medicaid office.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div> 

<h3 class="accordion-header">Financing and Financial Mapping	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul><li> MHAASA employs knowledgeable people capable of identifying information necessary to support the SAT-ED initiative's financing and financial mapping objectives.  </li>
  <li> MHAASA is using block grant dollars to serve adolescents.</li>
  <li> The current financing structure provides for equal reimbursement rates for both SUD and mental health disorder treatment. </li>
  <li> The SAT-ED leadership team has identified two Medicaid office representatives committed to working on the financing and financial mapping issues, including obtaining access to necessary data.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li> The interagency advisory council’s financing committee needs leadership with comprehensive knowledge and experience with SUD and mental health disorder treatment financing.  </li>
<li> Some challenges are related to the transition and change in care management related to the request for proposals for one or more new managed care organizations. </li>
<li> Miscommunication or misunderstanding about available child welfare and juvenile justice services may contribute to service duplication. </li>
<li> Stakeholders expressed concerns related to adolescent treatment access and capacity of the current SUD and mental health disorder treatment system; however, they also conveyed hope and commitment to moving forward through the financial mapping process that might resolve this problem. </li>
<li> It may be difficult to find and select financing committee members with a positive approach to moving forward rather than focusing on past deficits. </li>
<li> APS Healthcare’s reimbursement/payment rates are lower than MHAASA reimbursement rates.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Potential Enhancements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Awardee-Led Enhancements</b>
    <ul><li>Have the interagency committee lead the financial mapping process with representatives from all child-serving agencies.</li>
      <li> Have Puerto Rico’s interagency advisory council develop a data subcommittee to manage financial data. </li>
      <li> Carefully select the leaders of the financial mapping and data committees with knowledge of State systems and finance information/data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="accordion-header">Workforce Development	</h3> 
<div class="accordion-content"> 
<p><b>Strengths</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Puerto Rico’s interagency advisory council has developed a committee with representation from a diverse set of State agencies to fully develop a territory-wide workforce development plan. </li>

  <li> The workforce development committee has developed clear goals and objectives related to creating a territory-wide workforce development plan. </li>
  <li> The interagency advisory council has endorsed the goals and objectives presented by the workforce development committee. </li>
  <li> The workforce development plan is territory wide and considers the needs of both clinical staff and staff of other youth-serving agencies.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>   Developing and implementing a workforce development plan while simultaneously conducting workforce mapping activities may be challenging. </li>
  <li> The workforce development plan will need to include a section dedicated to developing the workforce at each of the two learning laboratory sites.  </li>
  <li> A sequenced plan must be developed that is structured at two levels: (1) knowledge exposure; and (2) skills-based training. Align with time and budget limitations.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The learning collaborative can be strengthened by having both sites communicate more consistently and in a structured manner to effectively share lessons learned and other resources. </li>
<li> Continuing care and recovery supports need to be further developed.  </li>
<li> Medicaid does not fully reimburse the actual costs of GAIN/A-CRA EBPs. </li>

<p>The Cooperative Agreements for the <b>State Adolescent and Transitional-Aged Youth Treatment Enhancement and Dissemination</b> (Short Title: <b>State Youth Treatment, or SYT</b>) initiative provides funding to improve treatment for adolescents (aged 12–18) and transitional-aged youth <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(18–24)</span> through the development of a learning laboratory with collaborating local community-based treatment provider sites.&nbsp;In October 2013, SAMHSA funded 4-year SYT cooperative agreements to the following 11 grantees:</p>
<ul>
<li> Alaska</li>
<li>Arizona*</li>
<li>Chickasaw Nation</li>
<li>Colorado</li>
<li>District of Columbia</li>
<li>Fallon Tribe</li>
<li>Idaho</li>
<li>Maryland (funded in August 2014)</li>
<li>Mississippi</li>
<li>Tennessee*</li>
<li>Vermont*
  <p>*Former SAC Grantee </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through the SYT award, the State or tribe collaborates with local community-based treatment provider sites in several ways: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Implement an evidence-based practice (EBP).</li>
  <li>Provide services to adolescents, transitional-aged youth, and their families or primary caregivers.</li>
  <li>Develop a feedback loop to identify barriers and test solutions through a services component operating in real time.</li>
</ul>
<p>To inform the process and improve systems issues, SYT grantees use grant funds to serve either youth aged 12–18 and their families, transitional-aged youth (18–24) and their families, or both populations. Mississippi is serving only adolescents, and Idaho is serving only transitional-aged youth. All other grantees are serving both populations.<br />
  Grantees are expected to achieve several outcomes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Address needed changes to policies and procedures.</li>
  <li>Develop financing structures that support the current service delivery environment.</li>
  <li>Develop and implement a statewide workforce development dissemination plan.</li>
  <li>Create a blueprint to increase the use of EBPs.</li>
</ul>
<p>To meet SYT program expectations, grantees are required to conduct several activities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improve interagency collaboration.</li>
  <li>Conduct financial mapping to inform the development of funding and payment strategies that are practical and feasible in the funding environment.</li>
  <li>Expand the qualified workforce to meet increasing service delivery needs.</li>
  <li>Disseminate EBPs.</li>
  <li>Involve adolescents, transitional-aged youth, and their families at all levels to inform policy, program, and effective practice implementation processes.</li>
</ul>

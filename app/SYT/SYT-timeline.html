                            <p>The Iowa Department of Public Health is implementing SBIRT in federally qualified health centers in four regions with demonstrated community need consistent with prevalence data, incidence of alcohol-related illness and poverty, and potential impact. In addition to successfully implementing SBIRT in primary care settings, Iowa has used evidence-based brief treatment and successfully adopted SBIRT within the Iowa Army National Guard, including the use of telehealth to serve soldiers in remote locations. Iowa SBIRT partners have demonstrated exemplary cooperation among State offices, primary care sites, behavioral health organizations, and the National Guard. The grantee has also developed manuals that support SBIRT implementation and GPRA followup.</p>

                            <p>The Arizona SBIRT program (AZ-SBIRT) aims to reduce substance-related mortality and the prevalence of substance use disorders in northern Arizona by expanding and enhancing the State’s system of behavioral health care to include SBIRT services. At the time of the site visit, five provider sites—including emergency departments and community health clinics—had begun implementing SBIRT at their facilities, with SBIRT services administered by existing staff. Grant funds had not been used to place personnel exclusively dedicated to implementing SBIRT at each site, and providers were administering only screenings and brief interventions and referring clients as needed to an outside entity to receive treatment. Several new provider sites were identified to implement SBIRT with their client populations in upcoming months, and services were scheduled to begin at Yavapai Regional Medical Center and Canyonlands Healthcare in July 2013 and at Kingman Regional Medical Center in January 2014. Medical providers and emergency department staff at all sites were to be trained on SBIRT protocols, and institutional policies were to be developed to prescreen all patients and adhere to the SBIRT process.</p>

                            <p>New Jersey SBIRT faced four challenges that delayed startup and implementation: (1) Hurricane Sandy created a public health and safety crisis, diverted State resources and attention, and shut down transportation at a critical time; (2) The former Department of Addiction Services merged with the Department of Mental Health to form the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, and several key personnel left or assumed new positions; (3) A calculation error in the State’s winning proposal required reconfiguring patient numbers and practice sites; and (4) The principal subcontractor changed its corporate status, requiring the State to reissue an RFP, select Henry J. Austin Health Center, and work creatively to engage other participating agencies. Because of these startup delays, New Jersey was placed on “high risk” and required to provide SAMHSA with a corrective action plan. At the time of the site visit, New Jersey had not yet completed and submitted the plan.</p>

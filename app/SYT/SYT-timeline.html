                          <p>The initiative has high-level support, and substance use disorders are receiving State attention. The project coordinator is developing a work plan to identify and implement upcoming tasks. The interagency council has invited key State agency stakeholders. A financial mapping workgroup has developed a financial mapping plan, collected preliminary aggregate data, and is disaggregating the data to identify expenditures specifically for adolescents and young adults. The initiative’s workforce development subcommittee includes representatives from the treatment community and from substance abuse, mental health, education, health, child welfare, juvenile justice, and Medicaid services State agencies. The two provider sites are implementing evidence-based practices that are well received by administrators and clinicians. The project’s experienced evaluator plans to develop a data workgroup and use data for decision-making and policy change.</p>

                          <p>The initiative’s high-level leadership and skilled, experienced staff have a history of successful cross-system collaboration. Its policy advisory council meets regularly and includes strong community-level and non-State agency representation. The team will continue to revise and update Alaska’s financial map to reflect cross-agency financial information. The team’s plan for dissemination of evidence-based practices includes training staff from multiple agencies. Several funding sources have been identified to support workforce development and dissemination activities. The project’s two experienced provider sites—serving a diverse population of youth and young adults referred from multiple sources—have high client retention rates. The project implementation team meets at least monthly and serves as a learning community.</p>

                          <p>The principal investigator is invested in the project, and the coordinator is experienced with the young adult population. The team has a long collaborative working relationship with partner agencies. The project’s monitoring and advisory group (MAG), with broad representation of key agencies and partners serving the target population, meets at least bimonthly. Many MAG partners believe the SYT award aligns well with their respective agency strategic plans. The team is developing the Idaho financial map, reaching out to State agencies that may provide services for the population, and will continue revising and updating the financial map. The team has a well-thought-out plan for training related to their selected evidence-based practices. The team is interested in moving to a more person-centered, recovery-oriented approach and model of care. Advisory boards in both provider regions include diverse representation, meet regularly, and have high energy and engagement levels.</p>

                          <p>Agency leadership has created an environment of progress and service evolution and is building on accomplishments and applying knowledge learned from previous Federal awards. The project team has a clearly articulated logic model and operations plan. The interagency council has a broad membership across relevant agencies, a history of interagency collaboration, and a productive working environment. The awardee has a cooperative and collaborative working relationship with Medicaid, previous exposure to financial mapping through other awards, and an executive committee that can influence data gathering for financial mapping. An experienced consultant assists with workforce development training, staff retention activities, implementation of evidence-based practices, fidelity, and referrals. The initiative’s four provider sites are culturally diverse, geographically representative of the District, dedicated to working with the population, and skilled in engaging youth.</p>

Site-level providers have a forum to interact and share information and resources with State administrators. Block grant funds are covering adolescent services. Staff have contacted many relevant agencies to obtain fiscal data, have received preliminary responses, and show good grasp of internal processes needed to begin financial mapping. The draft workforce development plan is clearly formatted and reflects numerous training activities, including GPRA data on trainings. The initiative’s provider sites are competent, dedicated, understand adolescent needs, and use the blending with wraparound model to provide comprehensive recovery support services.</p>

                            <p>The Arizona SBIRT program (AZ-SBIRT) aims to reduce substance-related mortality and the prevalence of substance use disorders in northern Arizona by expanding and enhancing the State’s system of behavioral health care to include SBIRT services. At the time of the site visit, five provider sites—including emergency departments and community health clinics—had begun implementing SBIRT at their facilities, with SBIRT services administered by existing staff. Grant funds had not been used to place personnel exclusively dedicated to implementing SBIRT at each site, and providers were administering only screenings and brief interventions and referring clients as needed to an outside entity to receive treatment. Several new provider sites were identified to implement SBIRT with their client populations in upcoming months, and services were scheduled to begin at Yavapai Regional Medical Center and Canyonlands Healthcare in July 2013 and at Kingman Regional Medical Center in January 2014. Medical providers and emergency department staff at all sites were to be trained on SBIRT protocols, and institutional policies were to be developed to prescreen all patients and adhere to the SBIRT process.</p>

                            <p>New Jersey SBIRT faced four challenges that delayed startup and implementation: (1) Hurricane Sandy created a public health and safety crisis, diverted State resources and attention, and shut down transportation at a critical time; (2) The former Department of Addiction Services merged with the Department of Mental Health to form the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, and several key personnel left or assumed new positions; (3) A calculation error in the State’s winning proposal required reconfiguring patient numbers and practice sites; and (4) The principal subcontractor changed its corporate status, requiring the State to reissue an RFP, select Henry J. Austin Health Center, and work creatively to engage other participating agencies. Because of these startup delays, New Jersey was placed on “high risk” and required to provide SAMHSA with a corrective action plan. At the time of the site visit, New Jersey had not yet completed and submitted the plan.</p>

    <h2>{{ page.title }} and Adolescent Program</h2>
</div>
  <p><strong>The Adolescent program </strong>supports funded initiatives focused on increasing the use of evidence-based substance abuse treatment for adolescents. It includes two grantee cohorts composed of 24 States, territories, or tribes: </p>
<ol>
  <li>State Adolescent Treatment Enhancement and Dissemination (known as SAT-ED) involving 13 grantees (12 States and 1 territory) serving youth 12–18 and their families </li>
  <li>State Adolescent and Transitional-Aged Youth Treatment Enhancement and Dissemination (known as SYT) involving 11 grantees (9 States and 2 tribes) serving either youth aged 12–18 and their families, transitional-aged youth (18–24) and their families, or both populations</li>
</ol>
<p>These youth or transitional-aged youth also encompass any of several target populations:
<ul>
  <li>Caucasians, African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and Asian/Pacific Islanders who are involved in the criminal justice or juvenile justice systems</li>
  <li>Individuals who have co-occurring mental health and substance use issues or are dually diagnosed</li>
  <li>Individuals who are homeless</li>
  <li>Individuals who live in diverse geographic locations ranging from large cities to suburban and rural areas</li>
</ul>
<p>Services to these populations are provided in settings such as youth service agencies, community mental health centers, nonprofit health providers, private clinics, local and State government agencies, university health centers, and hospitals.<br />
  To strengthen substance abuse services and systems, both SAMHSA initiatives involve a two-pronged approach:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>State/territory/tribe infrastructure      development and improvement (e.g., interagency collaboration, funding and payment strategies,      workforce development, family and youth involvement) using      30 percent of award funding </li>
  <li>Direct service delivery involving      evidence-based assessment and treatment practices using 70 percent of      award funding</li>
</ol>

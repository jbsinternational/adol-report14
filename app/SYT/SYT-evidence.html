<h3 class="clearfix">About These Evidence-Based Practices</h3>




<h4><a href="http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/ViewIntervention.aspx?id=41" target="_blank">A-CRA<span class="icon--external"></span></a></h4>
<p><b>Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA)</b> to alcohol and substance use treatment is a behavioral intervention that seeks to replace environmental contingencies that have supported alcohol or drug use with prosocial activities and behaviors that support recovery. This outpatient program targets youth 12 to 22 years old with DSM-IV cannabis, alcohol, and/or other substance use disorders. A-CRA includes guidelines for three types of sessions: adolescents alone, parents/caregivers alone, and adolescents and parents/caregivers together. According to the adolescent's needs and self-assessment of happiness in multiple areas of functioning, therapists choose from among 17 A-CRA procedures that address, for example, problem-solving skills to cope with day-to-day stressors, communication skills, and active participation in prosocial activities with the goal of improving life satisfaction and eliminating alcohol and substance use problems. Role-playing/behavioral rehearsal is a critical component of the skills training used in A-CRA, particularly for the acquisition of better communication and relapse prevention skills. Homework between sessions consists of practicing skills learned during sessions and participating in prosocial leisure&nbsp;activities.</p>  


<h4><a href="http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/ViewIntervention.aspx?id=41" target="_blank">A-CRA/ACC<span class="icon--external"></span></a></h4>
<p><b>Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA)</b> to alcohol and substance use treatment is a behavioral intervention that seeks to replace environmental contingencies that have supported alcohol or drug use with prosocial activities and behaviors that support recovery. This outpatient program targets youth 12 to 22 years old with DSM-IV cannabis, alcohol, and/or other substance use disorders.

Role-playing/behavioral rehearsal is a critical component of the skills training used in A-CRA, particularly for the acquisition of better communication and relapse prevention skills. Homework between sessions consists of practicing skills learned during sessions and participating in prosocial leisure activities.</p><p>A-CRA has been adapted for use with <b>Assertive Continuing Care (ACC)</b>, which provides home visits to youth following residential treatment for alcohol and/or other substance dependence. It also has been adapted for use in a drop-in center for street-living, homeless youth to reduce substance use, increase social stability, and improve physical and mental health. These adaptations are reviewed in this&nbsp;summary.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/ViewIntervention.aspx?id=333" target="_blank">Interactive Journaling<span class="icon--external"></span></a></h4>
<p><b>Interactive Journaling</b> is a goal-directed, client-centered model that aims to reduce substance abuse and substance-related behaviors, such as recidivism, by guiding adults and youth with substance use disorders through a process of written&nbsp;self-reflection.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/ViewIntervention.aspx?id=87" target="_blank">Matrix Model<span class="icon--external"></span></a></h4>
<p>The <b>Matrix Model</b> is an intensive outpatient treatment approach for stimulant abuse and dependence that was developed through 20 years of experience in real-world treatment settings. The intervention consists of relapse-prevention groups, education groups, social-support groups, individual counseling, and urine and breath testing delivered over a 16-week period. Patients learn about issues critical to addiction and relapse, receive direction and support from a trained therapist, become familiar with self-help programs, and are monitored for drug use by urine testing. The program includes education for family members affected by the addiction. The therapist functions simultaneously as teacher and coach, fostering a positive, encouraging relationship with the patient and using that relationship to reinforce positive behavior change. The interaction between the therapist and the patient is realistic and direct, but not confrontational or parental. Therapists are trained to conduct treatment sessions in a way that promotes the patient's self-esteem, dignity, and&nbsp;self-worth.</p>   

<h4><a href="http://nrepp.samhsa.gov/ViewIntervention.aspx?id=31" target="_blank">MET/CBT<span class="icon--external"></span></a></h4>
<p><b>Family Support Network (FSN)</b> is an outpatient substance abuse treatment program targeting youth ages 10-18 years. FSN includes a family component along with a 12-session, adolescent-focused cognitive behavioral therapy--called Motivational Enhancement Therapy/Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MET/CBT12)--and case management. The family component attempts to engage adolescents and their parents in a joint commitment to the treatment and recovery process. It establishes a support system, encourages family communication, and teaches parents behavioral management skills with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of family interrelationships. The family component includes:<ul><li>Six biweekly, multifamily education meetings addressing teen beliefs, adolescent development, adolescent drug use patterns, drugs and adolescents, the recovery process, and family management issues such as boundaries, parental discipline, and communication</li><li>Four monthly home visits to reinforce the family's commitment to treatment and help the adolescent and his or her family individualize the skills they learned.</li></ul></p><p>The MET/CBT12 component provides 2 individual sessions of MET that explore and resolve the youth's ambivalence about changing substance abuse behaviors and 10 group sessions of CBT that teach youth specific cognitive behavioral skills. These skills include refusing cannabis, problem solving, anger awareness and management, dealing with criticism, managing depression, coping with cravings, managing thoughts about marijuana, planning for emergencies, building a better social network, engaging in activities unrelated to drug use, and coping with&nbsp;relapse. </p> 








<h4><a href="http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/ViewIntervention.aspx?id=45" target="_blank">PLL<span class="icon--external"></span></a></h4>
<p><b>Parenting with Love and Limits (PLL)</b> combines group therapy and family therapy to treat children and adolescents aged 10-18 who have severe emotional and behavioral problems (e.g., conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder) and frequently co-occurring problems such as depression, alcohol or drug use, chronic truancy, destruction of property, domestic violence, or suicidal ideation. The program also has been used with teenagers with less extreme behaviors. PLL teaches families how to reestablish adult authority through consistent limits while reclaiming a loving relationship. It includes six multifamily sessions, conducted by two facilitators, that employ group discussions, videotapes, age-specific breakout sessions, and role-play. Individual families also receive intensive 1- to 2-hour therapy sessions in an outpatient or home-based setting to practice the skills learned in the group setting. Three or four family therapy sessions are recommended for low- to moderate-risk adolescents; up to 20 sessions may be recommended for those with more severe problems such as involvement with the juvenile or criminal justice system. PLL's integration of group sessions and family therapy is designed to help families apply skills and concepts to real-life situations and prevent&nbsp;relapse.</p>


<h4><a href="http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/ViewIntervention.aspx?id=139" target="_blank">Seeking Safety<span class="icon--external"></span></a></h4>
<p><b>Seeking Safety</b> is a present-focused treatment for clients with a history of trauma and substance abuse. The treatment was designed for flexible use: group or individual format, male and female clients, and a variety of settings (e.g., outpatient, inpatient, residential). Seeking Safety focuses on coping skills and psychoeducation and has five key principles: (1) safety as the overarching goal (helping clients attain safety in their relationships, thinking, behavior, and emotions); (2) integrated treatment (working on both posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance abuse at the same time); (3) a focus on ideals to counteract the loss of ideals in both PTSD and substance abuse; (4) four content areas: cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal, and case management; and (5) attention to clinician processes (helping clinicians work on countertransference, self-care, and other&nbsp;issues).</p> 

<h4><a href="http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov/ViewIntervention.aspx?id=159" target="_blank">Seven Challenges<span class="icon--external"></span></a></h4>
<p><b>The Seven Challenges (7C)</b> program focuses on trust and relationship building as primary motivators for change. Cognitive and emotional aspects of decision making are used to help adolescents think through their decisions about alcohol and drugs. Young people also are encouraged to use a Health-Decision Model, which involves evaluating their choices with regard to health consequences. The 7C program is designed specifically for adolescents with drug problems, to motivate a decision and commitment to change and to support success in implementing the desired changes. The program simultaneously helps young people address their drug problems as well as their co-occurring life skill deficits, situational problems, and psychological problems. The Challenges provide a framework for helping youth think through their own decisions about their lives and their use of alcohol and other drugs. Counselors using 7C teach youth to identify and work on the issues most relevant to them. In sessions, as youth discuss the issues that matter most, counselors seamlessly integrate the Challenges as part of the&nbsp;conversation.</p>

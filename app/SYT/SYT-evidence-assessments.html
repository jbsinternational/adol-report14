<h3 class="clearfix">About These Evidence-Based Assessments</h3>

<h4><a href="http://www.asam.org/publications/the-asam-criteria/about/" target="_blank">ASAM<span class="icon--external"></span></a>
</h4>
<p>The <b>American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM)</b> criteria, also known as the ASAM patient placement criteria, is the result of a collaboration that began in the 1980s to define one national set of criteria for providing outcome-orientated and results-based care in the treatment of addiction. Today the criteria have become the most widely used and comprehensive set of guidelines for placement, continued stay and transfer/discharge of patients with addiction and co-occurring conditions. The ASAM criteria are required in over&nbsp;30&nbsp;states.</p>

<h4><a href="http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/AssessingAlcohol/InstrumentPDFs/04_ASI.pdf" target="_blank">ASI<span class="icon--external"></span></a>
</h4>
<p>The <b>Addiction Severity Index (ASI)</b> is a semi-structured interview for substance abuse assessment and treatment planning. The ASI is designed to gather valuable information about areas of a client’s life that may contribute to their substance-abuse&nbsp;problems.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.evinceassessment.com/product_caape.html" target="_blank">CAAPE-5<span class="icon--external"></span></a></h4>
<p>The <b>Comprehensive Addictions and Psychological Evaluation-5 (CAAPE‐5)</b> is a comprehensive diagnostic assessment interview providing documentation for substance‐specific diagnoses based on DSM‐5 criteria. In 35‐50 minutes, the CAAPE‐5 covers some of the more prevalent mental health conditions likely to impact recovery from substance use disorders and collects key demographic information associated with&nbsp;prognosis.</p>

<h4><a href="http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/AssessingAlcohol/InstrumentPDFs/21_CASI.pdf" target="_blank">CASI<span class="icon--external"></span></a>
</h4>
<p>The <b>Comprehensive Adolescent Severity Inventory (CASI)</b> is a comprehensive, semi-structured, clinical assessment and outcomes interview. It is comprised of 10 independent modules, each incorporating objective, focused, and concrete questions. Modules include health, family, stressful life events, legal status, sexual behavior, AOD use, mental health functioning, peer relationships, education, and use of free time. Questions are formatted to identify whether certain behaviors have ever occurred regularly, how old the adolescent was when they first occurred regularly, and whether they occurred regularly during the past year (past month and other 11 months). Each module assesses whether the adolescent acknowledges the presence of problems and obtains his/her rating of discomfort. The CASI also includes questions designed to assess the strength-base of&nbsp;the&nbsp;youth.</p>



<h4><a href="http://www.aacap.org/aacap/Member_Resources/Practice_Information/CASII.aspx" target="_blank">CASII<span class="icon--external"></span></a></h4>
<p>The <b>Child and Adolescent Service Intensity Instrument (CASII)</b> (formerly called CALOCUS) is a tool to determine the appropriate level of care placement for a child or adolescent. The CASII links a clinical assessment with standardized "levels of care" and has a method for matching the two. The method consists of quantifying the clinical severity and service needs on six dimensions (eight ratings) that are standardized using anchor points. The ratings are quantified in order to convey information easily, but also provide a spectrum along which a child/adolescent may lie on any given dimension. This allows for a broad range of users to employ the&nbsp;CASII.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.gaincc.org/index.cfm?pageID=49" target="_blank">GAIN-I Full<span class="icon--external"></span></a>
</h4>
<p>The <b>Global Appraisal of Individual Needs Initial (GAIN-I) Full</b> is designed to collect as much information in about 1.5 to 2.5 hours on the participant's first day of treatment, as would often be collected in their first few months of treatment in many programs. The GAIN-I Full is also available in Spanish (Valoración Global de Necesidades Individuales Inicial or VGNI-I) and French (Evaluation Globale des Besoins Individuels or EGBI). The Spanish version was translated by a multilingual, multicultural translation workgroup for use with Spanish-speaking individuals in the United States. The French version was translated by a Quebec-based multilingual translation workgroup for use with French-speaking individuals in Quebec,&nbsp;Canada.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.gaincc.org/products-services/instruments-reports/gainq3/" target="_blank">GAIN-Q3<span class="icon--external"></span></a></h4>
<p>The <b>Global Appraisal of Individual Needs Q3 (GAIN-Q3)</b> is a brief, 20-45 minute assessment used to identify and address a wide range of problems among adolescents and adults in clinical and general populations. As a clinical tool, the GAIN-Q3 is designed for use by personnel in diverse settings that include employee assistance programs, student assistance programs, health clinics, juvenile justice, criminal justice, child welfare, mental health, and substance abuse treatment&nbsp;programs.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.evinceassessment.com/product_paddi.html" target="_blank">PADDI-5<span class="icon--external"></span></a></h4>
<p>The <b>Practical Adolescent Dual Diagnostic Interview-5 (PADDI-5)</b> is a comprehensive interview based on the DSM-5 for identifying co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders among adolescents. This interview enables both addiction and mental health professionals to document problems within their areas of expertise and make focused referrals for conditions outside their scope&nbsp;of&nbsp;practice.</p>

<h4><a href="http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/AssessingAlcohol/InstrumentPDFs/70_T-ASI.pdf" target="_blank">T-ASI<span class="icon--external"></span></a></h4>
<p>The <b>Teen Addiction Severity Index (TASI)</b> is a semi-structured interview that was developed to fill the need for a reliable, valid, and standardized instrument for a periodic evaluation of adolescent substance abuse. The T-ASI uses a multidimensional approach of assessment as an age-appropriate modification of the Addiction Severity Index. It yields 70 ratings in seven domains: chemical (substance) use, school status, employment/support status, family relations, peer/social relationships, legal status, and psychiatric&nbsp;status.</p>

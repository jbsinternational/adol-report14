    <h3 class="accordion-header">Awardee Leadership</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p>
            <b>The Requirement:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The required SAT-ED adolescent coordinator position must be vested with the authority to coordinate with all child-serving agencies that provide funding and other support for adolescents needing treatment services for substance use disorders (SUDs) or co-occurring mental disorders.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Lessons Learned</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>If a State elects to hire a grant writer to complete the application, State and local leaders need to be significantly involved in the development process.</li>
          <li>Early identification of a leader with extensive content knowledge and authority to coordinate tasks is critical to early success of the SAT-ED award.</li>
          <li>If possible, local provider sites should be identified before submitting the grant application. Provider leadership and staff should be involved in developing the project plan and implementation strategy. </li>
<li></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Challenges:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Several SAT-ED project coordinators hired lacked experience, upper management support, or authority, particularly during early SAT-ED implementation stages, to successfully lead at the level of policy or infrastructure change. </li>
            <li>Staff members serving in several project positions (e.g., single State authority [SSA] senior managers, direct service staff, evaluators) demonstrated a lack of understanding of project intent and expectations, which adversely affected timely implementation, readiness, accuracy, and capacity building. </li>
            <li>Awardees expressed challenges identifying site-level staff with experience working with adolescents and families or treating behavioral health issues, particularly SUDs.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Interagency Collaboration</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>The Requirement</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The SAT-ED award requires awardees to link and coordinate with other child-serving systems by establishing an interagency council or adding to an existing one. The required systems include mental health, education, health, child welfare, juvenile justice, and Medicaid (because SUD SSAs are the intended applicants, SUD representation is assumed). Parent and youth representatives are also required to be on the council to ensure the perspectives of these populations inform policy and practice.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Lesson Learned</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Development of or integration into an interagency collaboration at the highest levels is essential to a successful effort. The SAT-ED award goals and expectations cannot be met by the State&rsquo;s or territory&rsquo;s SSA alone. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Success Stories</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>All awardees have established some form of collaborative council or advisory board that includes a wide range of youth-serving interagency representatives and parent and youth representatives. </li>
          <li>One awardee&rsquo;s Joint Council on Children and Adolescents is an example: 
            <ul>
              <li>The joint council is composed of all child-serving agency directors and family representatives from the Federations of Families SC, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, and child advocacy groups (e.g., Children Trust, Children&rsquo;s Law Center). </li>
              <li>Joint council members have integrated the SAT-ED workplan into their operational agenda to improve outcomes for adolescents.</li>
              <li>The project&rsquo;s SAT-ED online learning management system serves as the joint council&rsquo;s official Web site, thereby maintaining a strong daily connection between the work of the SAT-ED team and its interagency council.</li>
              <li>The council uses a shared, revolving leadership model with its agency leaders. </li>
              <li>To ensure a family voice is heard, a family member is invited to each meeting to share his or her experience receiving services through one of the State&rsquo;s child-serving agencies. </li>
              <li>Although there is no youth consistently representing behavioral health on the joint council, the SAT-ED team is working diligently to add this critical voice. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges:</b></p>
      <ul>
          <li>Some awardees are still working hard to get all eight required representatives on board and the associated memorandums of understanding in place. </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">Financing and Financial Mapping</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p>
            <b>The Requirements</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Awardees are required to link and coordinate with financing mechanisms that include the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment block grant, Medicaid/Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program, private insurance, and other funding streams that provide treatment and recovery support services to adolescents with SUDs or co-occurring substance use and mental disorders and their families.</li>
          <li>Awardees are required to develop two financial maps that identify the multiple funding streams at the State/territory level used to support treatment, continuing care, and recovery services at the beginning and end of the award.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Lessons Learned</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Development of financing structures, mechanisms, and reforms that reimburse adolescent SUDs and co-occurring substance use and mental disorder treatment and recovery support systems is critical to the success of the SAT-ED initiative. </li>
        <li>Identifying available funding through financial mapping should be completed by the end of year 1 of the award to ensure a successful pathway to sustainability.</li>
        <li>The financial mapping process is best conducted in face-to-face meetings with interagency participants with many opportunities to increase understanding about the financial map&rsquo;s purpose and intended outcomes. Such a process may also facilitate trust among the partner agencies.        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Success Stories</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>In many cases, awardees referred financing challenges identified at the treatment provider site level to State-level interagency councils to be addressed through policy change.</li>
        <li>Because of policy-level efforts, one awardee&rsquo;s Medicaid program now covers treatment for youth with a primary SUD or a primary mental disorder equally under the Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment program.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          <b>Challenges</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Awardees are not sure whether or how current reimbursement strategies fit within larger financing or financial reform plans.
              <ul>
                <li>The reimbursement mechanisms awardees use to fund their SAT-ED treatment provider sites vary (e.g., traditional grant-in-aid, cost reimbursement, bundled rate reimbursement). </li>
                <li>Many SAT-ED awardees use their subcontracted SAT-ED provider funds to support a &ldquo;business-as-usual&rdquo; approach rather than test new funding mechanisms, such as vouchers, that would support sustainability.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Most awardees completed this requirement more than halfway through the grant, after SAMHSA specified the due date (not specified in the original RFA). </li>
            <li>Site visits, coaching activity, and awardee reports reflect significant variations in awardee understanding of and ability to complete financing requirements. </li>
            <li>Most awardees lack third-party reimbursement rates that align with the true costs of implementing the evidence-based practices (EBPs), and they are not typically reimbursed for administrative functions associated with ensuring fidelity to EBP implementation. In some instances, third-party purchasers, including managed care organizations, limit the number and types of services they will reimburse, placing them at odds with the requirements of SAT-ED EBPs. </li>
            <li>For youth with primary SUDs, services and supports are often scant, and reimbursements are nonexistent or far less robust than for youth with mental disorders. </li>
          <li>The most dramatic example is an awardee&rsquo;s Medicaid budget of $135 million for children&rsquo;s mental health compared with its Medicaid budget of $2 million for both children and adults with SUDs. </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Some awardees report these SUD disparities prevail at the highest policy and funding levels. </li>
              <li>The need to increase financing opportunities and reforms among all awardees is tremendous, particularly given the vast disparities in services and supports available to youth with primary SUD diagnoses.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Workforce Development</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>The Requirement</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The SAT-ED RFA requires awardees to expand workforce capacity to address youth with SUDs or co-occurring substance use and mental disorders and their families. Awardees can engage in several allowable activities to meet this requirement. They are required to develop a multiyear statewide workforce training implementation plan that identifies the types and methods of training to be delivered both to staff of the adolescent SUD/co-occurring substance use and mental disorder treatment and recovery sector and to staff of other child-serving agencies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Lessons Learned</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A comprehensive workforce development plan is critical to ensuring a SAT-ED project&rsquo;s sustainability.</li>
        <li>In addition to involving the behavioral health workforce, it is important to understand the training needs of other child-serving agency staff who work with youth with behavioral health disorders. </li>
        <li>The use of a survey may be helpful as long as it does not require too much time to execute.        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Success Stories</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Awardees conducted many workforce development events<strong></strong>such as the following:<strong></strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Training to improve overall general competencies in the statewide youth SUD and co-occurring mental disorder workforce (e.g., adolescent brain development, trauma-informed care, co-occurring disorders) </li>
            <li>Training for staff of other youth-serving agencies on youth SUDs and co-occurring disorders and referral processes </li>
            <li>Training on evidence-based assessment and treatment practices</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>One awardee&rsquo;s SAT-ED initiative has an online learning management system—a 24-hour Web-based platform that provides interactive, multimedia content and competency-based online testing—that can award continuing education unit certificates and incorporates a time management tool. This impressive and progressive effort and promising practice in workforce development will support system sustainability.      </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Implementation and Dissemination of Evidence-Based Practices</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <b>The Requirement</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The SAT-ED RFA requires awardees to select two local community-based treatment sites that must provide an evidence-based assessment and treatment model, outreach and other engagement strategies, recovery services and supports, and a learning laboratory to disseminate EBPs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Lessons Learned</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Awardees may benefit from prompt training and technical assistance following the award start date on EBP selection.</li>
        <li>Accurate estimates of staff certification time and EBP rollout time are key in the first year of the award.        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          <b>Success Stories</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Most awardees chose a version of the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN) instruments and the Assertive Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA) and Assertive Continuing Care (ACC) models. </li>
          <li>Most awardees&rsquo; EBPs were in place within 6 months of award; however, full implementation often took longer. Delays with implementation were typically associated with staffing contracted providers, developing a referral pipeline, and completing the often-rigorous developer-required training and/or certification processes. </li>
          <li>All awardees selected their evidence-based assessment and treatment practices and began intensive training/certification for implementation by the end of year 1.</li>
  <li>Although year 1 Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) targets were not met in many cases, 569 youth and their families were served in the first year. The SAT-ED management team noticed an upward trajectory in the GPRA data and expects to see continued improvements.</li>
  </ul>
        <p> <b>Challenges</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>SAT-ED awardees devoted much time during the first funding year to selecting their provider sites, selecting or finalizing their EBPs, participating in the requisite training and certification, and developing contracts to support these processes. </li>
          <li>State agency reorganization, staff turnover, mid-course changes in assessment or treatment models, and even weather emergencies adversely affected the number of treatment admissions. </li>
          <li>All awardees except Iowa initially selected a version of the GAIN assessment instrument. Montana switched from the GAIN instrument to the Teen Addiction Severity Index. Several challenges in the assessment process surfaced through site visits and awardee calls:
            <ul>
              <li>Lengthy assessment periods and perceived redundancies in assessment questions (assessment questions designed to determine respondent reliability) fostering youth distrust</li>
              <li>Engagement challenges</li>
              <li>Discharge without treatment completion</li>
              <li>Tools exceeding reimbursement parameters and contributing to unsustainable business models</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Awardees expressed concerns about the length of time needed to complete the GAIN instrument, the adverse effects on client and family engagement (including dropout), and misalignment with current third-party reimbursement parameters. 
            <ul>
              <li>In the first year, awardees could not commit to sustaining GAIN implementation after the SAT-ED award ends usually because of costs and engagement challenges. </li>
              <li>It is noteworthy that awardees&rsquo; comments on their inability to sustain implementation were made during or shortly after GAIN training. In other SAMHSA projects, these issues decreased as staff became more familiar with administering the instruments. </li>
              <li>A complicating factor is that some awardees are required by State policy to implement other assessment and treatment planning instruments such as biopsychosocial assessments and Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths. Although the information gleaned from these assessment instruments is useful, adolescents and their families may not perceive the value of completing these activities, may be affected by &ldquo;assessment fatigue,&rdquo; and are often eager to begin treatment. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Some third-party payers, including Medicaid, limit assessment reimbursement to one session, and sometimes even 1 hour. These reimbursement constraints do not support the administration of some of the GAIN instruments or any instrument that exceeds this time parameter.</li>
        </ul>

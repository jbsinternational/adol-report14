<h3>Why conduct a site visit?</h3>
<p>Site visits play a critical role in helping grantees succeed with program implementation. They provide an opportunity for grantees to focus their vision, solve problems, and implement individualized technical assistance to meet specific needs. These client-focused, change-oriented visits are undertaken to assess what is working well, identify what could be improved, and assist in developing action plans to ensure success.</p>
<h3>What approach underlies a site visit?</h3>
<p>Site visit teams use an approach based on a proven framework for enhancing strengths, addressing challenges, and identifying new opportunities. In general, enhanced service design and implementation depends on four themes: (1) strengths, (2) challenges, (3) collaboration or partnership, and (4) long-term success. <br />
  Focused on achieving measurable impact, the goal of a site visit is to enhance grantee strengths and assets toward continued improvement and sustainability. Through the onsite grantee visit process, grantee strengths are leveraged to address barriers while enhancing program success. By beginning from a strengths perspective rather than from a diagnostic viewpoint, the site visit team creates a space that enables the grantee to meet current challenges while embracing future possibilities. This perspective helps the team identify common issues so that lessons learned can be shared across the grantee cohort.<br />
  Six steps guide the approach to a site visit:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Engage with grantee and program staff and listen as they detail their history, successes, challenges, and vision for the future.</li>
  <li>Identify program strengths and assess which ones best facilitate ongoing growth and sustainability through an in-person approach.</li>
  <li>Identify program barriers and assess which ones most contribute to existing challenges for meeting award requirements.</li>
  <li>Identify steps best taken to enhance the program.</li>
  <li>Select priorities for the visit and targeted areas for technical assistance following the visit.</li>
  <li>Discuss steps moving forward, including how best to track and document accomplishments.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What happens during a site visit?</strong></h3>
<p>The site visit teams include staff from the technical assistance contractor (JBS International, Inc.) who engage in several team tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Engage grantees and key stakeholders in meaningful discussion.</li>
  <li>Observe and report on grantee implementation progress.</li>
  <li>Identify grantee strengths and challenges.</li>
  <li>Identify potential enhancements that might be supported by technical assistance, as approved by SAMHSA.</li>
  <li>Advise grantees on the critical issues related to funding sources, reimbursement strategies, and the Affordable Care Act.</li>
  <li>Provide technical assistance as needed during the visit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The site visit process includes multiple components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prepare for the visit, including the review of grant applications and periodic reports and discussions with program staff.</li>
  <li>Meet on site with the project director, project evaluator, project coordinator, clients, agency partners and leadership, and other key stakeholders.</li>
  <li>Provide relevant feedback to the grantee during an exit interview and discussion at the end of the visit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each site visit team also includes a coach consultant—a highly qualified individual with extensive relevant experience who has managed similar initiatives and is matched to the grantee. The coach provides direct peer-to-peer content and technical expertise before, during, and after each site visit. </p>
